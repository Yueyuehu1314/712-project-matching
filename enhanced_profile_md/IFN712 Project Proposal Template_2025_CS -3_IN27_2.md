Okay, let's start by looking at the user's query. They want a student profile for Finley Wilson with specific details. The project requires Python, visualization, programming, and machine learning skills. The student is in the IN27 course, which is Data Analytics.

First, I need to fill in the basic information as provided: name, student ID, major, year, and course background. The user specified the major as Data Analytics and the course background as IN27. The year isn't given, so I'll assume a realistic level, maybe third-year since they have several advanced courses.

Next, the academic background section needs to highlight IN27 and the relevant courses. The completed courses listed include IFN712, IFN701, etc. I should connect these courses to the project's required skills. For example, IFN707 and IFN709 are Machine Learning courses, which directly relate to the project's machine learning requirement. IFN708 is Data Visualization, which is another key skill. I'll mention how these courses have equipped Finley with the necessary technical skills.

For project experience, the user didn't provide specific project names, so I'll create plausible ones. Maybe something like "Predictive Analytics for Customer Churn" using machine learning. Another could be "Interactive Sales Dashboard" for visualization. A third might involve Python programming in a data analysis context. Each project should be a brief description linking to the required skills.

Work experience should reflect relevant internships or part-time roles. Perhaps a Data Analyst Intern where they applied Python and machine learning. Keep it concise, around 100 words.

Interests should include data science, programming, etc., aligning with the technical skills. Technical skills need to list Python, visualization tools like Tableau or Power BI, machine learning libraries like scikit-learn, and programming languages like SQL or R.

I need to ensure all sections are filled according to the markdown format provided. Check that each part matches the project requirements and the IN27 background. Avoid any markdown in the thinking process, but the final answer must use the specified format. Also, make sure the matched project title and generation time are included. Let me verify each section again for consistency and relevance to the project's needs.
