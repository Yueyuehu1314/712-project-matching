Okay, let's start by understanding the user's request. They want a student profile for Finley Flores, an IN20 Computer Science major, tailored to the project titled "IFN712 Project Proposal Template_2025_CS -3". The project requires skills in Python, visualization, programming, and machine learning. 

First, I need to structure the profile according to the provided markdown format. The Basic Information section is already given, so I'll just format that correctly. 

Next, the Academic Background should highlight Finley's IN20 background. I should mention the courses listed, especially those relevant to the project. Since the project involves machine learning and Python, I should emphasize courses like IFN709 - Advanced Machine Learning and IFN702 - Advanced Programming. Also, mention the research methods and software engineering courses to show a well-rounded background.

Completed Courses are listed, so I'll just list them as bullet points. 

For Project Experience, the user provided three projects. Each needs a concise description. The first project, "Machine Learning for Environmental Monitoring," should focus on Python, machine learning models, and visualization. The second, "Interactive Data Visualization Dashboard," should highlight Python libraries like Matplotlib and Plotly. The third project, "Research Project on AI Ethics," should tie in research methods and ethical considerations in AI.

Work Experience should be within 100 words. Since the user didn't provide specific details, I'll create a relevant internship, maybe at a data science company, using Python and ML, to align with the project requirements.

Interests should include areas related to the project, like machine learning, data visualization, etc. Technical Skills need to list the required skills (Python, visualization tools, ML frameworks) and others like SQL, Git, etc., from the completed courses.

Finally, ensure the Matched Project section correctly links the project title and generation time. I need to check that all the courses and projects align with the project's technical skills and major requirements. Also, make sure the profile is realistic for an IN20 student, showing progression from foundational to advanced courses. Avoid any markdown in the thinking process, but the final answer must strictly follow the markdown format provided.
