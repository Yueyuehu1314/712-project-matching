Okay, let's start by understanding the user's request. They want a student profile for Taylor Harris, who is in the IN27 Data Analytics major. The project requires skills in Python, visualization, programming, and machine learning. The user provided specific courses completed, so I need to make sure those are included.

First, the basic information is given: name, student ID, major, year, and course background. Since the user didn't specify the year, I'll assume a typical year level, maybe third year. 

For the academic background, I should highlight IN27 courses and how they relate to the project. Mentioning the core courses like Research Project, Research Methods, and Machine Learning will show relevant expertise. Also, the student's focus on data analysis and machine learning aligns with the project's requirements.

Completed courses are listed, so I'll list them exactly as provided. Project experience needs three projects, each around 50 words. I'll create projects that use Python, visualization, and machine learning. For example, a predictive analytics project using Python and ML, a visualization dashboard with tools like Tableau or Power BI, and another ML project like sentiment analysis.

Work experience should be brief, maybe an internship related to data analytics. Interests should reflect technical and non-technical areas, like coding, data science, etc. Technical skills need to include Python, visualization tools (Tableau, Power BI, Matplotlib, Seaborn), programming languages (R, SQL), and machine learning frameworks (Scikit-learn, TensorFlow).

I need to ensure all required skills from the project are covered and that the profile is realistic for an IN27 student. Also, check the word counts for each section to keep them within the specified limits. Finally, format everything in the required markdown structure without any markdown in the thinking process.
