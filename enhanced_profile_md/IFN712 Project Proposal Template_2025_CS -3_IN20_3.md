Okay, let's start by looking at the user's request. They need a student profile for a project titled IFN712 Project Proposal Template_2025_CS -3. The required skills are Python, visualization, programming, and machine learning. The student is Emery Taylor with IN20 background.

First, I need to structure the profile as per the markdown format provided. The basic info is given, so I'll fill that in. For the academic background, I should highlight IN20 courses and how they relate to the project. Emery's completed courses include Research Project, Advanced Programming, Software Engineering, etc. I need to connect these to the required skills.

Project experience should showcase relevant projects. Since the project requires machine learning and visualization, I'll create projects that involve Python, data analysis, and ML models. Maybe a predictive analytics project using Python and scikit-learn, a data visualization dashboard with Plotly, and a machine learning model for sentiment analysis.

Work experience should be concise, mentioning internships or roles that apply these skills. Emery might have an internship where they developed ML models or worked on data visualization tools.

Interests should reflect areas related to the project. Coding, AI, data visualization, etc. Technical skills need to include Python, machine learning libraries, visualization tools, and programming languages like Java or C++ from their courses.

I need to ensure all sections are filled according to the format, with the right word counts. Academic background should be 150-200 words, each project around 50 words. Also, check that the skills listed match the project requirements. Make sure the matched project title is correct and the generation time is current. Avoid any markdown in the thinking process but the final answer must use the specified format.
