Okay, let's start by looking at the user's query. They want a student profile for Tyler Johnson with a specific project and course background. The project requires Python, visualization, programming, and machine learning skills. The student is in the IN27 program, which is Data Analytics.

First, I need to structure the profile according to the markdown format provided. The basic info is given, so I'll fill that in. For the academic background, I should highlight relevant courses and how they relate to the project. Courses like IFN707 and IFN709 are about machine learning, which is required. IFN708 is visualization, another key skill.

Next, the completed courses list is already provided, so I just need to list them properly. Project experience should include three projects that showcase the required skills. Maybe a machine learning model, a visualization project, and a research project. Each project description should be concise and mention the relevant skills.

Work experience needs to be brief, around 100 words. Since the user didn't specify any, I'll create a realistic internship related to data analytics. Maybe an internship where the student applied Python and ML in a real-world scenario.

Interests should reflect someone in data analytics—maybe data science, coding, etc. Technical skills should include Python, machine learning libraries, visualization tools like Tableau or Power BI, and programming languages like SQL or R.

I need to make sure all the required skills from the project are covered in the profile. Also, check that the courses and projects align with the IN27 background. Avoid any markdown in the thinking process, just plain text. Let me verify each section again to ensure nothing's missing. The matched project is given, so just include that at the end with the current time. Alright, time to put it all together in the specified format.
