Okay, let's start by understanding the user's request. They want a student profile for Rory Johnson with an IN20 background, specifically for a project titled IFN712 Project Proposal Template_2025_CS -3. The project requires Python, visualization, programming, and machine learning skills.

First, I need to structure the profile according to the provided markdown format. The basic info is given, so I'll fill in the Name, Student ID, Major, Year, and Course Background. The user mentioned the student is in IN20, so the year should be appropriate, probably second or third year.

Next, the Academic Background section. Since the student is in IN20, I should highlight their foundational courses and how they relate to the project. Mention the completed courses provided by the user, like IFN712, IFN701, etc. I need to connect these courses to the required skills, especially machine learning and Python.

Completed Courses are listed, so I'll just format those as bullet points.

Project Experience needs three projects. Each should be around 50 words. I'll create relevant project names and descriptions that align with the technical skills required. For example, a machine learning project using Python, a data visualization project, and maybe a software engineering project that ties in programming.

Work Experience should be within 100 words. Maybe a role as a research assistant or intern related to machine learning or data analysis.

Interests should reflect both academic and personal, including programming, data science, etc.

Technical Skills need to include Python, visualization tools like Matplotlib or Tableau, machine learning libraries like Scikit-learn, and programming languages like Java or C++. Also, software engineering tools like Git.

Matched Project section is straightforward with the given title and current time.

I need to ensure all the information is consistent with the IN20 background and the project requirements. Check that the skills and courses listed align with what's needed for the project. Also, make sure the profile is realistic for a student at that academic level. Avoid any markdown in the thinking process, but the final output should follow the markdown structure provided.
