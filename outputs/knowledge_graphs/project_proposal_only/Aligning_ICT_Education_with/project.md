| Brief description of the research | The rapid evolution of the ICT    |
| problem, aims, method and         | industry is placing growing       |
| expected outputs (100\~200 words) | pressure on universities,         |
|                                   | students, and employers to        |
|                                   | maintain alignment between        |
|                                   | education and professional        |
|                                   | practice. A recurring challenge   |
|                                   | is the persistent misalignment    |
|                                   | between the skills acquired       |
|                                   | through university study and the  |
|                                   | competencies required in          |
|                                   | contemporary ICT roles. This      |
|                                   | skills gap contributes to         |
|                                   | underemployment, critical         |
|                                   | shortages in emerging fields, and |
|                                   | reduced productivity in the       |
|                                   | digital economy.                  |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | This project aims to              |
|                                   | systematically identify and       |
|                                   | bridge the skills gap between ICT |
|                                   | education and industry            |
|                                   | requirements through a            |
|                                   | stakeholder-driven, data-informed |
|                                   | analysis. Drawing on business     |
|                                   | analysis methodologies, the       |
|                                   | project will investigate the      |
|                                   | needs of key                      |
|                                   | stakeholders---including          |
|                                   | students, educators, and          |
|                                   | employers---and evaluate the      |
|                                   | alignment between expected job    |
|                                   | competencies and existing         |
|                                   | university course offerings.      |
|                                   |                                   |

|                                   | against course learning outcomes, |
