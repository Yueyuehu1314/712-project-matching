| Project title                     | Zero-Day Attack Detection Using   |

+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
| Brief description of the research | Zero-day attacks exploit unknown  |
| problem, aims, method and         | vulnerabilities and often bypass  |
| expected outputs (100\~200 words) | traditional rule-based security   |
|                                   | mechanisms, making them difficult |
|                                   | to detect using signature-based   |
|                                   | methods. This project aims to     |
|                                   | develop a machine learning-based  |
|                                   | approach to detect zero-day       |
|                                   | cyberattacks by identifying       |
|                                   | anomalous patterns in network     |
|                                   | behavior. Using public datasets   |
|                                   | containing both normal and known  |
|                                   | attack traffic, the project will  |
|                                   | train unsupervised and            |
|                                   | semi-supervised machine learning  |
|                                   | models capable of learning normal |
|                                   | behavior and flagging deviations. |
|                                   | Techniques such as Isolation      |
|                                   | Forest, One-Class SVM, and        |
|                                   | Autoencoder-based models will be  |
|                                   | explored. Data preprocessing will |
|                                   | include normalization,            |
|                                   | dimensionality reduction, and     |
|                                   | feature engineering. The          |
|                                   | performance of selected models    |
|                                   | will be evaluated using metrics   |
|                                   | like precision, recall, and       |
|                                   | F1-score, with a specific focus   |
|                                   | on their ability to detect        |
|                                   | previously unseen attack types.   |
|                                   | Expected outcomes include a       |
|                                   | functional detection model, a     |
|                                   | comprehensive performance report, |
|                                   | and practical recommendations for |
|                                   | improving early threat detection  |
|                                   | in real-world environments.       |
