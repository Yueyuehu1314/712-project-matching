| Brief description of the research | This project aims to conduct a    |
| problem, aims, method and         | comprehensive literature review   |
| expected outputs (100\~200 words) | on the correlation analysis of    |
|                                   | diabetes-related complications    |
|                                   | using medical imaging data,       |
|                                   | particularly focusing on heart,   |
|                                   | foot, and retinal images.         |
|                                   | Diabetes mellitus is a chronic    |
|                                   | disease associated with a range   |
|                                   | of severe complications,          |
|                                   | including cardiovascular disease, |
|                                   | diabetic foot ulcers, and         |
|                                   | diabetic retinopathy.             |
|                                   | Understanding the                 |
|                                   | interrelationships among these    |
|                                   | conditions through imaging data   |
|                                   | can support early diagnosis, risk |
|                                   | stratification, and integrated    |
|                                   | treatment planning.               |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | The primary aim is to identify    |
|                                   | and evaluate existing studies     |
|                                   | that have analyzed correlations   |
|                                   | between diabetes factors using    |
|                                   | image-based diagnostics. The      |
|                                   | methodology involves a systematic |
|                                   | search and critical analysis of   |
|                                   | peer-reviewed articles, focusing  |
|                                   | on image processing techniques,   |

|                                   | methods for correlation analysis, |
|                                   | and clinical outcomes.            |
