| Brief description of the research | As the Internet of Things (IoT)   |

|                                   | IoT environments from             |
|                                   | cyberattacks becomes increasingly |
|                                   | critical. IoT traffic datasets    |
|                                   | often contain a large number of   |
|                                   | features, many of which may be    |
|                                   | irrelevant or redundant, reducing |
|                                   | model performance and             |
|                                   | interpretability. This project    |
|                                   | aims to investigate how different |
|                                   | feature selection techniques      |
|                                   | affect the accuracy and           |
|                                   | efficiency of IoT attack          |
|                                   | detection models. Using datasets  |
|                                   | such as CIC-IoT-2023, the project |
|                                   | will apply various selection      |
|                                   | methods---including ANOVA F-test, |
|                                   | mutual information, and recursive |
|                                   | feature elimination (RFE)---to    |
|                                   | identify the most relevant        |
|                                   | features. These feature sets will |
|                                   | be used to train and evaluate     |
|                                   | traditional machine learning      |
|                                   | models (e.g., Random Forest, SVM, |
|                                   | XGBoost), comparing accuracy,     |
|                                   | F1-score, training time, and      |
|                                   | model complexity. The project     |
|                                   | will produce a ranked list of     |
|                                   | impactful features, a performance |
