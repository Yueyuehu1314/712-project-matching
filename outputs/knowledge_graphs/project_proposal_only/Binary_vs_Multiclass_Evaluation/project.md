| Brief description of the research | Intrusion detection systems (IDS) |
| problem, aims, method and         | are essential for identifying     |
| expected outputs (100\~200 words) | malicious activity in IoT         |
|                                   | environments, where networks are  |
|                                   | often constrained and highly      |
|                                   | vulnerable. Most detection models |
|                                   | follow either a binary            |
|                                   | classification approach (normal   |
|                                   | vs. attack) or a multiclass       |
|                                   | approach (e.g., DoS, DDoS, MitM,  |
|                                   | Infiltration). This project aims  |
|                                   | to compare the effectiveness and  |
|                                   | limitations of both methods using |
|                                   | the same IoT cyber attack dataset |
|                                   | (such as CIC-IoT-2023). Students  |
|                                   | will train and evaluate standard  |
|                                   | machine learning classifiers      |
|                                   | (e.g., Random Forest, SVM,        |
|                                   | XGBoost) on both binary and       |
|                                   | multiclass-labeled datasets. The  |
|                                   | models will be evaluated based on |
|                                   | metrics such as accuracy,         |
|                                   | F1-score, confusion matrix, and   |
|                                   | false positive rate. The project  |
|                                   | will explore which approach       |
|                                   | provides better real-world        |
|                                   | applicability in terms of         |
|                                   | detection precision and           |
|                                   | deployment complexity. Expected   |
|                                   | outcomes include a comparative    |
|                                   | analysis report, visualization of |
|                                   | results, and practical            |
|                                   | recommendations on when to use    |
|                                   | binary or multiclass IDS          |
|                                   | depending on organizational       |
|                                   | needs.                            |
