| Brief description of the research | This project investigates how the |
| problem, aims, method and         | Internet of Things (IoT) supports |
| expected outputs (100\~200 words) | smart city solutions to enhance   |
|                                   | urban living, sustainability, and |
|                                   | public safety. It examines key    |
|                                   | technologies - sensors,           |
|                                   | communication networks, and data  |
|                                   | analytics - applied in areas such |
|                                   | as flood control, earthquake      |
|                                   | detection, environmental          |

|                                   | response. Exploring real-world    |
|                                   | implementations, the study        |
|                                   | compares technologies, system     |
|                                   | architectures, and deployment     |
