      "description": "industry is placing growing pressure on universities, students, and employers to maintain alignment between education and professional practice. A recurring challenge is the persistent misalignment between the skills acquired through university study and the competencies required in contemporary ICT roles. This skills gap contributes to underemployment, critical shortages in emerging fields, and reduced productivity in the digital economy.  This project aims to systematically identify and bridge the skills gap between ICT education and industry requirements through a stakeholder-driven, data-informed analysis. Drawing on business analysis methodologies, the project will investigate the needs of key stakeholders---including students, educators, and employers---and evaluate the alignment between expected job competencies and existing university course offerings.  Data sources will include the Skills Framework for the Information Age (SFIA), real-time job listings from SEEK, and QUT's Master of Information Technology (MIT) curriculum. The project will map job skill requirements against course learning outcomes, assess the responsiveness of current study plans, and identify priority areas for curriculum improvement.  ###  **Expected Outcomes** {#expe cted-outcomes}  1.  A detailed analysis of > mismatches between ICT job > market demands and the > learning outcomes of QUT's > Master of Information > Technology (MIT) > curriculum, using SFIA and > SEEK data as benchmarks.  2.  A structured synthesis of > insights from students, > educators, and employers, > highlighting priority skill > areas, perceived > deficiencies, and emerging > competency needs in ICT.  3.  A practical framework based > on business analysis > methodologies for mapping > course content to job > competencies, enabling > educators to evaluate and > adjust program offerings > systematically.  4.  Actionable recommendations > for course design and study > planning, focusing on > high-impact skill areas > such as cybersecurity, data > analytics, cloud computing, > and software development. ICT Skills Gaps, Curriculum Alignment, Business Analysis, Stakeholder Engagement, SFIA Framework, Data-Driven Education 1.  What are the core skills and competencies currently in demand across the ICT job market, as reflected in real-time job listings and frameworks such as SFIA?**\\ ***Purpose:* To establish a data-driven baseline of employer expectations and emerging skill requirements in the ICT sector.  2.  To what extent do the learning outcomes and course offerings in QUT's Master of Information Technology (MIT) program align with the skills required in professional ICT roles?**\\ ***Purpose:* To assess curriculum relevance and identify potential gaps or redundancies in course content.  3.  What are the key areas of mismatch between the skills developed through ICT education and those needed for employability and career readiness, as perceived by students, educators, and employers?**\\ ***Purpose:* To incorporate stakeholder perspectives into the skills gap analysis and highlight areas of priority concern.  4.  How can business analysis methodologies be applied to systematically map and evaluate the alignment between course content and job market competencies?**\\ ***Purpose:* To develop a replicable framework that supports data-informed curriculum planning and review.  5.  What curriculum changes or study planning strategies can be recommended to better prepare ICT graduates for industry needs, particularly in high-demand areas such as cybersecurity, data analytics, and cloud computing?**\\ ***Purpose:* To produce actionable, evidence-based recommendations for curriculum improvement and study pathway design. **Skills Framework for the Information Age (SFIA).** (2021). *SFIA Version 8 Reference Guide.* https://sfia-online.org/en/sfia-8 \\ **World Economic Forum.** (2020). *The Future of Jobs Report.*\\ https://www.weforum.org/reports/t he-future-of-jobs-report-2020.  **Healy, M., Hammer, S., & McIlveen, P.
