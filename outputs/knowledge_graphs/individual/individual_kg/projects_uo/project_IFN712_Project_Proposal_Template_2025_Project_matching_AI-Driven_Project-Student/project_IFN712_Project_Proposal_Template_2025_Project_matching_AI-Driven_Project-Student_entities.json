      "description": "methodological foundations for matching research projects with suitable researchers without relying on publicly-available, fully-labelled datasets. The research addresses fundamental challenges in academic and industry environments where traditional matching approaches fail due to inherent constraints and uncertainties. The research environment is characterised by uncertain data volume, where the number and richness of project descriptions and researcher profiles fluctuate widely across organisations and time periods. Additionally, no reliable ground-truth labels exist, as there is no large corpus of \\\"successful match vs. failed match\\\" outcomes available for training or benchmarking. Strict privacy and security constraints further complicate the environment, as project briefs may contain proprietary ideas and researcher profiles may hold personal data that cannot leave institutional boundaries.  This investigation systematically examines four orthogonal design dimensions to develop robust methodological approaches for project-researcher matching under these constraints. The central challenge involves researching, prototyping and evaluating design choices across these dimensions when ground-truth is missing and usable data may be scarce or siloed.  **Research Objectives:**  The investigation addresses four design dimensions through specific methodological developments:  -   **Canonical Matching > Process**: Determine > optimal sequences and > combinations of processing > steps (preprocessing, > candidate retrieval, > re-ranking, rule-based > filtering, explanation) > through comparative > analysis of pipeline > architectures, ablation > studies on component > contributions, and > development of quality > metrics that operate > without ground-truth > labels.  -   **Adaptive Pipeline Design**: > Examine the effects of > varying run-time autonomy > levels from fixed pipelines > to self-adaptive agents > through implementation > across the autonomy > spectrum, development of > self-monitoring mechanisms, > and analysis of consistency > versus adaptability > trade-offs.  -   **Multi-Tool Orchestration**: > Establish criteria and > frameworks for selecting > and governing retrieval, > ranking, and reasoning > tools (vector search, BM25, > cross-encoders, LLM > scoring, knowledge graphs) > through development of tool > selection criteria, > comparative evaluation > across data regimes, and > meta-learning approaches > for tool orchestration.  -   **Privacy-Preserving > Matching**: Integrate > security techniques > (differential privacy, > federated computation, > access-controlled knowledge > stores) while maintaining > performance through > implementation of > privacy-preserving > techniques, development of > privacy-utility trade-off > metrics, and security > analysis under adversarial > conditions.
