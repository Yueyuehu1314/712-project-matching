      "description": "Vulnerable Road Users (VRUs)---including pedestrians, cyclists, and scooter riders---face a disproportionately high risk of collisions at signalized intersections due to limited situational awareness and delayed warnings. While intelligent transport systems have improved vehicular safety, few solutions offer direct, real-time communication between roadside infrastructure and VRUs. The widespread adoption of smartphones, combined with reliable mobile broadband and comprehensive mapping services, presents an opportunity to bridge this gap. Leveraging Google Maps APIs for precise geolocation and high‐speed mobile data links, this project addresses critical safety challenges by empowering VRUs with actionable, context-aware alerts.  **Objectives:**  1.  Real-Time Positioning & Mapping**:** Integrate Google Maps APIs to continuously track VRU location and intersection geometry.  2.  Safety Zone Detection: Define dynamic zones around signalized intersections where collision risk is highest.  3.  Bi-Directional V2P Communication**:** Enable two-way data exchange between VRUs' smartphones and roadside units (RSUs) to broadcast signal phases and hazard warnings.  4.  Multimodal Alerts & UI: Design a user interface that delivers visual, auditory, and haptic notifications tailored to VRU mode and risk level.  5.  Backend Computation: Develop cloud‐based services to fuse position data, signal timing, and predictive models in real time.  6.  Validation: Conduct bench and field trials to evaluate system performance under diverse traffic scenarios.  **Expected Outcomes:**  A minimum viable functional prototype will be developed and tested in both controlled and live environments to evaluate communication latency, positioning accuracy, and user acceptance. The project will demonstrate the practical use of a mobile application enabling real-time communication and interaction between devices in road environments. The findings will provide critical insights into the technical feasibility and design considerations for leveraging smartphones to enhance vulnerable road user (VRU) safety at urban intersections. In addition, the results will inform policy recommendations for the integration of vehicle-to-pedestrian (V2P) safety applications within existing transport infrastructure and networks -   Vulnerable Road User (VRU) Safety  -   Vehicle-to-Pedestrian (V2P) Communication  -   Real-Time Positioning & Mapping  -   Google Maps API Integration  -   Multimodal Alerts & Haptic Feedback  -   Mobile Broadband Connectivity Research Questions:  -   How does the integration of Google Maps APIs affect in-field positioning accuracy for pedestrians, cyclists, and scooter users at signalized intersections compared to standalone GNSS solutions?  -   What spatial and temporal parameters for dynamic \"safety zones\" around intersections minimize false alarms while maximizing early detection of potential conflicts for different VRU modes?  -   How does end-to-end latency in bi-directional V2P communication with MQTT protocols---under typical mobile-broadband conditions---impact the timeliness and reliability of hazard warnings delivered to VRUs?  -   Which combination of visual, auditory, and haptic alert modalities yields the fastest response times and highest user acceptance among VRUs during live field trials? 1)  Anne, L., Nandan, T., Kunj, M. *et al.* MQTT-Based Android Chat Application for IoT. *SN COMPUT.
