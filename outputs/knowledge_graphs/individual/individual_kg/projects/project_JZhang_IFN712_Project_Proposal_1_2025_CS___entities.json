      "description": "comprehensive literature review on the correlation analysis of diabetes-related complications using medical imaging data, particularly focusing on heart, foot, and retinal images. Diabetes mellitus is a chronic disease associated with a range of severe complications, including cardiovascular disease, diabetic foot ulcers, and diabetic retinopathy. Understanding the interrelationships among these conditions through imaging data can support early diagnosis, risk stratification, and integrated treatment planning.  The primary aim is to identify and evaluate existing studies that have analyzed correlations between diabetes factors using image-based diagnostics. The methodology involves a systematic search and critical analysis of peer-reviewed articles, focusing on image processing techniques, statistical or machine learning methods for correlation analysis, and clinical outcomes.  Expected outputs include:  1.  A categorized summary of existing research and methodologies;  2.  Identification of gaps in the literature;  3.  Recommendations for future research directions, particularly the integration of multi-modal imaging data for comprehensive diabetic complication analysis.  This review will provide a foundational understanding for researchers and clinicians to develop holistic diagnostic tools and personalized treatment strategies.  ![6 Diabetes Vascular Complications - And How To Avoid Them](media/image1.jpeg){width=\"5 .778466754155731in\" height=\"7.43125in\"}  ![Diabetes complications stock illustration.
