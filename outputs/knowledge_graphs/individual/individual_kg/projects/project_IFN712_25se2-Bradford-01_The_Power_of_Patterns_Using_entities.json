      "description": "functions as part of the bacterial immune response, defending against viral infections. In the lab, it has been repurposed as a powerful gene-editing tool. It finds the right gene in the DNA by looking for a matching 20-letter genetic sequence. DNA can be billions of characters in length.  A critical challenge in CRISPR experiment design is ensuring that the system targets only the intended gene, avoiding unintended (off-target) effects.  Our previous research has tackled this by developing specialised data structures and scoring algorithms to estimate the likelihood of off-target activity. Each successive iteration has improved the efficiency of our methods without compromising accuracy, although there remains potential for further enhancements.  The first generation used contiguous k-mers (substrings of length k) to look up, in constant time, other sequences with similar content. For example, AATTCCGG can be broken into its contiguous 2-mers: AA, TT, CC, GG. The position-sensitive 2-mer TT would identify CCTTCCGG, AATTGGAA and GGTTACGG as neighbours, but not TTAACCGG. Specifically, for CRISPR, the 20-character sequence is split into five, position-sensitive 4-mers.  The latest generation shifted the approach from using contiguous k-mers to using longer, gapped k-mer patterns. For example, a gapped 6-mer pattern could be \"TT\\_C\\_AA\\_T\" (the underscore allows for any character in its place). This gapped k-mer pattern captures a more precise set of similar sequences. Specifically, we used 28 gapped 8-mers. While the size of the k-mer set was larger (from five to 28), it reduced analysis time by 10-fold.  However, the selected set of gapped k-mers is not ideal. We know for certain there is one optimal set, yet it is difficult to find. A naïve approach would find it amongst the 10^180^ options, but that is an impossible task. So, how do we find it?  This project calls upon those with strong skills in computer science and mathematics to find that solution. You will be hands-on with binary vectors, solving set-coverage problems, and genetic algorithms (those with a search heuristic and optimisation technique). Having background knowledge of relevant biological concepts would be useful but not a necessity. CRISPR, set coverage, data structures, binary vectors, genetic algorithms, optimisation This project can be approached from multiple angles, so the research questions remain rather broad but would be narrowed down quite soon after commencing. Here are some to get started:  -   How can the optimal set of gapped k-mer patterns be found?  -   If some accuracy is sacrificed, what is a reasonable set of gapped k-mers that would not risk experimental outcomes?  -   How can high-performance computing technologies further improve the run-time of the analysis?  -   How could a hybrid approach be implemented that first approximates risk, and then determines whether a more precise evaluation is necessary? 1)  Schmitz, C., Bradford, J., Salomone, R., & Perrin, D.
