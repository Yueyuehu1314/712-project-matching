      "description": "vulnerabilities and often bypass traditional rule-based security mechanisms, making them difficult to detect using signature-based methods. This project aims to develop a machine learning-based approach to detect zero-day cyberattacks by identifying anomalous patterns in network behavior. Using public datasets containing both normal and known attack traffic, the project will train unsupervised and semi-supervised machine learning models capable of learning normal behavior and flagging deviations. Techniques such as Isolation Forest, One-Class SVM, and Autoencoder-based models will be explored. Data preprocessing will include normalization, dimensionality reduction, and feature engineering. The performance of selected models will be evaluated using metrics like precision, recall, and F1-score, with a specific focus on their ability to detect previously unseen attack types. Expected outcomes include a functional detection model, a comprehensive performance report, and practical recommendations for improving early threat detection in real-world environments. Zero-Day Detection, Anomaly Detection, Machine Learning, Cybersecurity, Unsupervised Learning, Threat Intelligence -   How effectively can unsupervised or semi-supervised ML models detect zero-day attacks by modeling normal network behavior?  -   Which machine learning techniques offer the best balance between detection performance and false positive rate?  -   How do different feature selection and preprocessing methods affect anomaly detection accuracy?  -   What are the limitations of using public datasets for simulating zero-day attack scenarios? 1)  Sommer, R., & Paxson, V.
