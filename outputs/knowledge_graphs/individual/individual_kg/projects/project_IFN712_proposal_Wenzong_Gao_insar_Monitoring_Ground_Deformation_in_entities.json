      "description": "critical for understanding the stability of urban infrastructure and for mitigating risks from natural and human-induced changes such as groundwater extraction, construction, mining, or earthquakes. Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) is a satellite-based remote sensing technique that enables precise measurement of surface movement over large areas and time periods by comparing radar images of the same location taken at different times. This technology can detect even millimetre-level changes in ground elevation, regardless of weather or lighting conditions.  This project aims to investigate ground deformation across the Brisbane area using InSAR technology. The approach involves collecting freely available SAR data (such as Sentinel-1 satellite images) covering the Brisbane region, and processing these images using the SNAP (Sentinel Application Platform) software to generate interferograms and deformation maps. A key focus of this project is to study the impact of using different types of orbit files (such as precise or restituted orbits) and various Digital Elevation Model (DEM) files during the InSAR processing workflow. By comparing results from different processing options, the project will highlight how orbit and DEM choices affect the accuracy and quality of the final deformation maps.  The processed results will be analysed to identify, map, and quantify any patterns of ground movement in different parts of Brisbane. The project will result in a reproducible workflow for SAR data processing, clear visualizations and measurements of detected deformation, and practical recommendations for ongoing monitoring or further geospatial studies in the region. -   What are the practical steps in generating interferograms and deformation maps using SNAP software?  -   How do different choices of orbit files and DEM files affect the results of InSAR deformation analysis?  -   What deformation patterns, if any, are observed in the Brisbane area over the selected time period?  -   What are the limitations and challenges when using InSAR to monitor urban ground deformation? -   Ferretti, A., Monti-Guarnieri, A., Prati, C., Rocca, F., & Massonet, D.
