      "description": "are essential for identifying malicious activity in IoT environments, where networks are often constrained and highly vulnerable. Most detection models follow either a binary classification approach (normal vs. attack) or a multiclass approach (e.g., DoS, DDoS, MitM, Infiltration). This project aims to compare the effectiveness and limitations of both methods using the same IoT cyber attack dataset (such as CIC-IoT-2023). Students will train and evaluate standard machine learning classifiers (e.g., Random Forest, SVM, XGBoost) on both binary and multiclass-labeled datasets. The models will be evaluated based on metrics such as accuracy, F1-score, confusion matrix, and false positive rate. The project will explore which approach provides better real-world applicability in terms of detection precision and deployment complexity. Expected outcomes include a comparative analysis report, visualization of results, and practical recommendations on when to use binary or multiclass IDS depending on organizational needs. IoT Security, Binary Classification, Multiclass Detection, Intrusion Detection, Cyber Attacks, Model Evaluation -   How does binary classification performance compare with multiclass models in IoT cyber attack detection?  -   What are the trade-offs in terms of accuracy, false positives, and interpretability between both approaches?  -   Which attack types are most frequently misclassified in a multiclass setup?  -   How should model complexity and use case requirements influence the choice between binary and multiclass IDS? 1)  Hodo, E., et al.
