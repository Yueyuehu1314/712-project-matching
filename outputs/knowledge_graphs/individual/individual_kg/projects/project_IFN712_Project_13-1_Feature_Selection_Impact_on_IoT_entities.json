      "description": "expands across smart homes, cities, and industries, securing IoT environments from cyberattacks becomes increasingly critical. IoT traffic datasets often contain a large number of features, many of which may be irrelevant or redundant, reducing model performance and interpretability. This project aims to investigate how different feature selection techniques affect the accuracy and efficiency of IoT attack detection models. Using datasets such as CIC-IoT-2023, the project will apply various selection methods---including ANOVA F-test, mutual information, and recursive feature elimination (RFE)---to identify the most relevant features. These feature sets will be used to train and evaluate traditional machine learning models (e.g., Random Forest, SVM, XGBoost), comparing accuracy, F1-score, training time, and model complexity. The project will produce a ranked list of impactful features, a performance comparison report, and practical insights for designing more effective and lightweight intrusion detection systems in IoT networks. IoT Security, Feature Selection, Intrusion Detection, ANOVA, Mutual Information, Cybersecurity -   How do different feature selection techniques influence the performance of ML models in detecting IoT-based attacks?  -   Which features are most frequently selected across different selection methods?  -   What trade-offs exist between model accuracy, interpretability, and training time when using reduced feature sets?  -   Which feature selection technique offers the best performance-to-complexity ratio for lightweight intrusion detection? 1)  Ferrag, M.
