      "description": "comprehensive literature review on deep learning approaches for disease detection using medical X-ray imaging data. X-ray remains a widely used diagnostic modality for detecting various conditions such as pneumonia, fractures, dental issues, and lung abnormalities. With the rapid advancement of deep learning, numerous models have been developed to improve diagnostic accuracy, speed, and consistency in interpreting X-ray images.  The primary aim is to identify and evaluate recent studies that apply deep learning techniques to disease detection in X-ray imaging. The methodology involves a systematic search and critical review of peer-reviewed articles, focusing on model architectures (e.g., CNNs, Transformers), datasets, performance metrics, and clinical relevance.  Expected outputs include:  1.  A categorized summary of existing deep learning models and their applications in X-ray diagnostics.  2.  Identification of gaps in current literature, such as lack of generalizability, data limitations, or insufficient interpretability.  3.  Recommendations for future research directions, including model robustness and integration into clinical workflows.  This review will provide valuable insights for researchers and practitioners seeking to advance AI-driven diagnostic tools in medical imaging.  ![](media/image1.png){width=\"5.81 0430883639545in\" height=\"3.8201388888888888in\"}  ![](media/image2.png){width=\"3.64 63418635170606in\" height=\"5.46951334208224in\"} -   **Deep Learning**  -   **Medical Imaging(X-ray)**  -   **Classification, Recognition, Detection**  -   **Multi-modal Diagnostics**  -   **Chest-X-ray, Bone Abnormalities, Fracture, Tooth disease** -   What types of X-ray imaging are most commonly used for the detection of diseases affecting different anatomical regions, such as the chest, bones, and oral cavity?  -   What statistical or deep learning methods have been applied to identify patterns or correlations across disease presentations in different X-ray modalities (e.g., chest vs. extremity vs. dental X-rays)?  -   To what extent can features extracted from one type of X-ray (e.g., chest X-ray for pneumonia) be leveraged to support the diagnosis or prediction of conditions in other regions (e.g., bone fractures or dental pathologies)?  -   How can deep learning models effectively integrate multi-region X-ray imaging data to support comprehensive and cross-system disease analysis, given challenges such as data heterogeneity and annotation variability?  -   What critical gaps exist in the current literature regarding the use of X-ray based deep learning models for multi-region or systemic disease correlation, and how can future research address these? 1.
