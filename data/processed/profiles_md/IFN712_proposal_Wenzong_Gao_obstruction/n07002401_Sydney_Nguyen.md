Okay, let's start by looking at the project requirements. The project is about testing and validating the impact of signal obstructions on GNSS systems like GPS. The required majors are Data Science and Computer Science, and the technical skills needed are data science and business analysis. The student provided has a list of completed courses, so I need to make sure those are included.

First, the basic information is given: Sydney Nguyen, student ID n07002401. Major should be Data Science or Computer Science. Since the project combines both, maybe list Data Science with a focus on Computer Science? Year level is not specified, but given the courses, perhaps third-year? 

Academic background needs to highlight relevant coursework. The courses provided include databases, advanced programming, data analytics, computer systems, systems analysis, machine learning, intro to programming, and advanced data analytics. I need to tie these to the project's needs. For example, data analytics and visualization skills would help in analyzing GNSS data, machine learning for predictive modeling, and systems analysis for understanding how obstructions affect systems.

Project experience should show hands-on work. Maybe include a project on GNSS signal analysis, a data-driven urban planning project using spatial data, and a machine learning model for environmental impact. Each project should be around 50 words.

Work experience: The user didn't provide any, but maybe include a part-time role in data analysis or a research assistant position related to the field.

Interests should align with the project. Things like geospatial data, machine learning, environmental tech, data visualization, and system optimization.

Technical skills need to include data science and business analysis. From the courses, skills in SQL, Python, data visualization tools, machine learning algorithms, systems analysis, and maybe GIS software. Also, business analysis tools like Tableau or Power BI.

Make sure the matched project is the given title and the generation time is current. Check for consistency and that all required elements are covered without markdown.
