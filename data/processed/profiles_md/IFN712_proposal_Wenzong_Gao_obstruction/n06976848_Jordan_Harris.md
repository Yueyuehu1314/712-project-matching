Okay, let's start by understanding the user's request. They need a student profile for Jordan Harris with specific courses and the project "Testing and Validating the Impact." The project is about GNSS systems and their signal obstructions. The required majors are Data Science and Computer Science, and the technical skills needed are data science and business analysis.

First, I need to structure the profile as per the provided markdown format. The basic info is given, so I'll fill in the Name, Student ID, Major, and Year. Since the project is in Data Science, I'll set the major accordingly and assume a third-year student based on the courses completed.

Next, the Academic Background should highlight relevant coursework and skills. The completed courses listed include databases, advanced programming, data analytics, etc. I should mention how these courses have equipped Jordan with data processing, analysis, and programming skills. Emphasizing machine learning and data visualization is important since they're part of the project's requirements.

For Project Experience, I need to create three projects related to data analysis and systems evaluation. The first project could involve analyzing GNSS data with Python and SQL. The second might be a machine learning model for signal prediction. The third could focus on visualizing data to show signal degradation effects. Each project should be around 50 words.

Work Experience should include something relevant, like an internship where Jordan applied data analysis and business skills. Maybe a data analyst internship where they worked with real-world datasets and collaborated with teams.

Interests should align with the project's technical aspects and business analysis. Including data analysis, machine learning, geospatial tech, business strategy, and data visualization makes sense.

Technical Skills need to cover both data science and business analysis. Python, SQL, machine learning libraries, data visualization tools (Tableau, Power BI), and business analysis methodologies should be listed.

Finally, ensuring the profile matches the project requirements, focusing on evaluating signal obstructions through data analysis and validation. The matched project title and current time generation are straightforward.

I need to check that all sections are filled correctly, the word counts are respected, and the content aligns with the project's needs. Making sure the courses and projects demonstrate Jordan's ability to handle GNSS data, perform analysis, and apply business insights. Avoiding any markdown and keeping the thinking process natural and in English.
