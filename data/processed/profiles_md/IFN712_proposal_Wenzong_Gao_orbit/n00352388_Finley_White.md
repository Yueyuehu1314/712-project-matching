Okay, I need to create a student profile for Finley White based on the given project. The project is about Machine Learning-Based Prediction for GNSS systems. Let me start by looking at the basic information provided. The name is Finley White, Student ID n00352388, and the completed courses. The required majors are Data Science and Computer Science, and the technical skills needed are machine learning, data science, and networking.

First, the major should be either Data Science or Computer Science. Since the project combines both, maybe Data Science with a minor in Computer Science. The year level should be a senior, like 3rd or 4th year. Let's go with 3rd year for now.

Academic background needs to highlight relevant courses and skills. Finley has taken courses in Object Oriented Programming, Algorithms, Advanced Data Analytics, Machine Learning, etc. I should mention how these courses have prepared him for the project. For example, IFN564 Machine Learning would give him the ML skills, and IFN632 Advanced Data Analytics covers data science. Networking isn't explicitly listed in the courses, but maybe through Computer Systems Fundamentals or Systems Analysis. I need to connect that.

Project experience: The user provided three projects. Let me think of projects related to GNSS and ML. Maybe a GPS signal analysis project using ML for error prediction. Another could be a data analytics project for sensor data. Third might involve network protocols, which ties in networking skills.

Work experience: Maybe an internship at a tech company working on data pipelines or ML models. That would show practical application of skills.

Interests should include things like machine learning, data analysis, GPS tech, software dev, and robotics. Technical skills need to list Python, R, SQL, TensorFlow, PyTorch, networking protocols, etc.

I need to ensure all the required skills are covered. Networking is part of the requirements, so I should mention courses like Computer Systems Fundamentals that touch on networking basics. Also, the project experience should reflect using networking concepts.

Check if the completed courses match the required skills. Machine learning is covered by IFN564. Data science by IFN632. Networking through IFN551. That should be okay.

Now, putting it all together in the specified markdown format. Make sure each section is properly filled, with academic background around 150-200 words. Project descriptions around 50 words each. Work experience concise. Technical skills list all relevant ones.
