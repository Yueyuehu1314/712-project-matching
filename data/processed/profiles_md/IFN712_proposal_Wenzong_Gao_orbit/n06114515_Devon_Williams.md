Okay, let's start by understanding the user's query. They need a student profile for a project titled "Machine Learning-Based Prediction" related to GNSS systems. The project requires majors in Data Science and Computer Science, with skills in machine learning, data science, and networking. The provided student information includes Devon Williams with specific completed courses.

First, I need to structure the profile in the required markdown format. The basic info is given, so I'll fill in the name, student ID, major (Data Science), and year (probably 3rd or 4th year based on the courses). 

Next, the academic background should mention relevant coursework and how it aligns with the project. Courses like Machine Learning, Advanced Data Analytics, and Algorithms are key here. I need to highlight how these courses provide a foundation for the project's requirements. Maybe mention specific projects or skills gained from these courses.

Completed courses are listed, so I'll format those as a bullet list. Make sure they match the ones provided.

Project experience needs three projects. Since the example projects aren't given, I need to invent plausible ones related to machine learning and data analytics. For example, a predictive analytics project using ML, a data pipeline project, and a real-time data processing project. Each should be a brief description linking to the project's needs.

Work experience should be a short paragraph. Maybe an internship at a tech company working on data analysis or ML projects. Highlight relevant skills like data preprocessing, model development, and collaboration.

Interests should include things like AI, data analysis, networking, etc. Technical skills need to list machine learning algorithms, Python, TensorFlow, SQL, networking protocols, etc. Ensure these align with the required skills.

Matched project is already given, so just format that section correctly. Generation time is the current time, which I'll note as the current date and time.

I need to check that all sections are filled out properly, using the required format. Make sure the academic background and project experience tie into the project's focus on GNSS and machine learning. Avoid any markdown in the thinking process, but the final answer must adhere strictly to the markdown structure provided.
