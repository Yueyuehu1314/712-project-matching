Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants a student profile for Harper Harris based on the given project. First, I need to parse the project details. The project is about dynamic analysis of third-party packages for security threats. Required skills include machine learning, web dev, data science, cybersecurity, etc. The student has courses in systems analysis, cyber security, programming, databases, networking, web tech, and OOP.

So, the major should align with cybersecurity or software engineering. Maybe Cybersecurity with a focus on software security. Academic background needs to highlight relevant courses and how they relate to the project. For example, IFN623 Cyber Security covers threat detection, which is directly relevant. IFN552 Systems Analysis would help in understanding system structures. Web Technologies (IFN666) ties into web development skills required.

Project experience should showcase dynamic analysis, machine learning models for security, and web tools. Maybe a project on malware detection using ML, another on network security tools, and a web app with secure practices. Work experience could be an internship in cybersecurity, applying dynamic analysis and ML. Technical skills need to list machine learning, Python, web frameworks, cybersecurity tools, databases, etc. Interests should reflect cybersecurity, ethical hacking, ML, open-source contributions. Ensure all required skills from the project are covered. Check the major and year level. Maybe 3rd-year Cybersecurity. Make sure the matched project title is filled, but it's missing in the input. Wait, the project title in the user's info is empty. Oh, maybe the user forgot to fill it. But the profile still needs to reference the project title. Hmm, maybe the user expects me to generate a title based on the description. The description mentions dynamic analysis for malicious packages. So a possible title could be "Dynamic Analysis Framework for Detecting Malicious Behavior in Open-Source Packages." Generation time is current, so today's date. Need to ensure all sections are filled as per the format. Let me structure each part step by step.
