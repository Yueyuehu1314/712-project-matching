Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants a student profile for Avery Davis based on the given project info. First, I need to understand the project. It's about dynamic analysis for detecting malicious packages in open-source repositories. The required majors are probably cybersecurity or computer science. The technical skills needed are machine learning, web dev, data science, etc.

Avery's courses include Systems Analysis, Cyber Security, Intro to Programming, Databases, Security and Networking, Computer Systems, Web Technologies, and OOP. So, I need to connect these courses to the project requirements. For example, IFN623 Cyber Security covers security principles, which is directly relevant. IFN666 Web Technologies would relate to web development. Machine learning isn't listed in the courses, but maybe Avery has self-taught or project experience in that area.

The academic background should highlight relevant courses and skills. Project experience should include something related to security tools, dynamic analysis, or web apps. Work experience might be in cybersecurity or software development. Technical skills should include machine learning, web dev (like React, Node.js), data science (Python, Pandas), cybersecurity (Wireshark, Kali Linux), etc.

Interests should align with cybersecurity, ethical hacking, machine learning. Need to make sure everything ties back to the project's needs. Also, check the word counts for each section to stay within limits. Let me structure each part step by step, ensuring the profile is realistic and matches the project's requirements.
