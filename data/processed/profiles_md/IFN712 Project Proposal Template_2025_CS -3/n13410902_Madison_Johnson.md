Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants a student profile for a project that deals with cybersecurity, specifically analyzing third-party packages for malicious behavior. The required majors include cybersecurity, data science, etc., and the technical skills needed are machine learning, web dev, data science, etc.

First, the student's name is Madison Johnson, Student ID n13410902. The major should align with the project's needs. Cybersecurity is a required major, so maybe Computer Science with a focus on Cybersecurity. Year level—probably a 3rd or 4th-year student since they've taken advanced courses.

Looking at the completed courses provided: IFN552 Systems Analysis and Design, IFN623 Cyber Security, IFN555 Intro to Programming, IFN554 Databases, IFN553 Intro to Security and Networking, IFN551 Computer Systems Fundamentals, IFN666 Web Technologies, IFN556 Object Oriented Programming. These courses cover systems design, cybersecurity, programming, databases, networking, web tech, and OOP. So the academic background should highlight these areas, emphasizing cybersecurity and systems analysis.

For the academic background section, I need to connect the courses to the project's requirements. Mention experience in systems analysis, cybersecurity principles, programming, databases, networking. Highlight skills in web development from IFN666, and object-oriented programming. Also, note the understanding of computer systems from IFN551.

Project experience: The user mentioned dynamic analysis and machine learning. So, possible projects could involve developing a web-based tool for malware detection using machine learning (linking to IFN666 and IFN623), a network security simulation using OOP (IFN556), and a database system for threat intel (IFN554). Each project should be around 50 words, so concise but relevant.

Work experience: Maybe a cybersecurity intern where they analyzed threats and developed tools. This shows practical application of their skills.

Interests should align with the project. Cybersecurity, machine learning, web dev, ethical hacking, network security.

Technical skills need to include machine learning, web dev (HTML/CSS/JS, Python), cybersecurity tools (Wireshark, Nmap), databases (SQL, NoSQL), Python, Java (from OOP course), data analysis (Pandas, NumPy), and cloud computing (AWS, Azure). These match the required skills.

Matched project is the one given, and generation time is current. Need to make sure everything is in the right format and matches the project's needs. Check that all required skills are covered and the academic background justifies the profile.
