Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants a student profile for Kendall Scott that matches a specific project. First, I need to understand the project details. The project is about detecting malicious third-party packages using dynamic analysis. The required majors are probably related to cybersecurity or computer science. The technical skills needed include machine learning, web development, data science, cybersecurity, mobile development, and networking.

Kendall's completed courses are listed, so I need to map those to the required skills. Courses like IFN623 Cyber Security and IFN553 Security and Networking cover cybersecurity. Web Technologies (IFN666) and Programming courses (IFN555, IFN556) relate to web and software development. Systems Analysis and Design (IFN552) might tie into project management or system design aspects.

For the academic background, I should highlight Kendall's focus on cybersecurity and software development. Mentioning relevant courses and how they apply to the project is key. For example, IFN623 would provide knowledge on security threats, which is directly relevant. The project experience should include past projects that involve similar skills. Maybe a dynamic analysis tool for malware, a web app with security features, and a network security project.

Work experience could be an internship in cybersecurity, applying those skills. Technical skills need to list the required ones. Also, interests should align with cybersecurity, machine learning, etc. I need to ensure the profile is realistic, not overqualified, and fits a student's level. Let me check the word counts and structure to meet the user's format requirements. Make sure the matched project title is filled and the time is current. Avoid any markdown except the specified format. Let me piece all this together step by step.
