Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants a student profile for a project related to dynamic analysis of third-party packages. The project seems to involve cybersecurity and machine learning. The required majors are not specified, but the student's courses include cybersecurity, programming, and web tech.

First, the student's name is Quinn Garcia, ID n10415240. Need to match the project's technical skills: machine learning, web dev, data science, cybersecurity, mobile dev, networking. The courses listed include Systems Analysis, Cyber Security, Programming, Databases, Security and Networking, Computer Systems, Web Technologies, and OOP. 

I should structure the academic background to highlight relevant courses. For example, IFN623 Cyber Security would be key. Also, mention projects that tie into dynamic analysis or malware detection. Work experience could be a cybersecurity internship. Technical skills need to include Python, machine learning frameworks, web dev tools, etc. 

Interests should align with the project, like ethical hacking, secure coding. Make sure the Academic Background and Project Experience sections connect to the project's aims. Need to ensure that the skills listed match the required ones. Also, check the project description to see if there are specific methods mentioned, like dynamic analysis, which should be reflected in the student's experience. 

Wait, the project description mentions dynamic analysis as a method. So Quinn's projects should include something related to that. Maybe a project on malware detection using dynamic analysis. Also, the expected outputs might involve tools or models, so Quinn's skills in Python, TensorFlow, Flask would be relevant. 

Need to make sure the completed courses are all listed correctly as per the user's input. The Work Experience could be at a cybersecurity firm doing vulnerability assessments. Technical skills should cover Python, machine learning, web frameworks, databases, etc. 

Interests should be in areas that complement the project, like cybersecurity research, AI in security. Let me structure all that into the profile, ensuring each section meets the project's requirements and the user's specifications.
