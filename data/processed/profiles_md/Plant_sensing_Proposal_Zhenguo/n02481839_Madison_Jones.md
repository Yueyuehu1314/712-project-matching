Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants a student profile for Madison Jones with specific courses and project details. First, I need to make sure all the given info is included.

The project is about IoT-based spectral sensing in agriculture. Required majors are Software Development and Computer, so Madison's major should be in that area. Let me check the courses provided. She has courses in software engineering, databases, cybersecurity, mobile app dev, systems fundamentals, OOP, systems analysis, and intro to programming. That's a solid tech background. Her major should probably be Software Engineering or Computer Science.

Academic background needs to be 150-200 words. Highlight her courses and how they relate to the project. Mention her coursework in software engineering, databases, cybersecurity, mobile apps, etc. Emphasize skills like machine learning, web development, data science, and networking which are required. Maybe mention her hands-on experience with IoT or data analysis.

Completed courses are listed, so just list them as provided.

Project experience: The user didn't provide specific projects, so I need to create fictional ones that align with the project. For example, a mobile app for plant health using IoT sensors, a cybersecurity project for IoT networks, and a data analytics tool for environmental data. Each should be around 50 words.

Work experience: Maybe a part-time job related to software development or IT. Internship or tech support role?

Interests: Should include things like IoT, machine learning, sustainability, etc.

Technical skills: The required ones are machine learning, web dev, data science, cybersecurity, networking. Also include others from her courses like OOP, databases, mobile development.

Matched project is the given one, with current time.

Need to ensure all the required elements are there and the profile is realistic. Let me structure each section step by step, making sure to connect her academic and project experiences to the project requirements.
