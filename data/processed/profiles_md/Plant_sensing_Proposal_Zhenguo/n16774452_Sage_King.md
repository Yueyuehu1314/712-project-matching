Okay, let's start by understanding the user's requirements. They want a student profile for a project titled "IoT-Based Spectral Sensing." The project is about agriculture and environmental monitoring using spectral reflectance analysis. The required majors are Software Development and Computer, and the technical skills needed include machine learning, web development, data science, cybersecurity, and networking.

The user provided basic info: Name Sage King, Student ID n16774452, and completed courses listed. I need to generate the rest of the profile. 

First, the academic background should highlight relevant areas. Since the project involves IoT, maybe mention coursework in software engineering, databases, cybersecurity, and systems. Also, since machine learning is required, maybe include a course or project related to that. The student's major is likely Software Development or Computer Science. Let's say Software Development.

Completed courses are given, but I need to list them properly. The user listed courses like IFN668 Advanced Software Engineering, IFN554 Databases, etc. I should present those under the Completed Courses section.

Project experience: The project is about IoT and spectral sensing. So past projects should relate to IoT, data analysis, mobile apps, cybersecurity. Maybe a project on an IoT-based environmental monitoring system, another on a mobile app for data collection, and a third on secure data transmission. Each project should be around 50 words.

Work experience: The user didn't provide any, so I need to make something relevant. Maybe an internship in software development with a focus on IoT or data analysis. Or part-time work in cybersecurity or web development.

Interests should align with the project. Maybe environmental tech, machine learning, IoT devices, sustainable agriculture, data visualization.

Technical skills need to include the required ones: machine learning, web dev, data science, cybersecurity, networking. Also, programming languages like Python, JavaScript, SQL. Maybe tools like TensorFlow, React, Node.js, Docker, AWS.

Matched project is the given one, with generation time.

Now, structuring all this into the markdown format. Academic background should connect the courses to the project needs. For example, Advanced Software Engineering for system design, Databases for data management, Cyber Security for securing IoT networks, Mobile App Development for user interfaces, etc.

Project experiences: First project could be an IoT environmental monitoring system using sensors and data analysis. Second, a mobile app for real-time data. Third, securing data transmission in IoT networks.

Work experience: Maybe a part-time role in a tech startup focusing on IoT solutions, or a cybersecurity analyst intern.

Interests: Environmental sustainability, AI in agriculture, IoT innovation, data science, open-source projects.

Technical skills: Python, JavaScript, SQL, TensorFlow, React, Node.js, Docker, AWS, REST APIs, Git, Agile methodologies.

Check that all required elements are included and match the project's needs. Ensure the profile is realistic, with skills and background that align with the project's technical and academic requirements.
