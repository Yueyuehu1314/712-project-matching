Okay, I need to generate a student profile for Blake Moore based on the given project requirements. Let me start by understanding the project. The project is about IoT-Based Spectral Sensing in agriculture and environmental monitoring. The key areas are detecting plant stress using spectral reflectance, which requires software development, computer skills, and specific technical skills like machine learning, web development, data science, cybersecurity, and networking.

First, Blake's major should be something that covers software development and computer aspects. The required majors are Software Development and Computer, so maybe he's majoring in Software Engineering or Computer Science. Since the example uses "Computer Systems" as a major, I'll go with that. Year level: since he has completed several advanced courses, maybe he's a third-year student.

Academic background: Needs to reflect courses related to software engineering, databases, cybersecurity, mobile apps, computer systems, programming. His completed courses include IFN668, IFN554, etc. So his academic background should mention these courses and how they relate to the project. For example, Advanced Software Engineering for IoT systems, databases for data management, cybersecurity for securing data, mobile app development for user interfaces, and systems fundamentals for hardware integration.

Project experience: He should have projects related to IoT, machine learning, web apps, and data analysis. Let me think of three projects. Maybe a smart greenhouse IoT system, a machine learning model for plant disease detection using image data, and a secure web-based dashboard for environmental data. Each project should be around 50 words.

Work experience: Maybe an internship where he worked on IoT or software development. For example, an intern at a tech startup where he developed mobile apps and worked on IoT data pipelines with Python and JavaScript.

Interests: Should align with the project. Maybe environmental tech, open-source hardware, data visualization, machine learning, and cybersecurity.

Technical skills: The required skills are machine learning, web development, data science, cybersecurity, networking. Plus others from his courses. So skills like Python, JavaScript, SQL, React, Node.js, TensorFlow, AWS, REST APIs, Git, Docker, etc.

Check if all required courses are included. His completed courses are listed, so they should be in the list. Make sure the academic background connects each course to relevant skills for the project.

Now, structure all this into the markdown format. Make sure the technical skills cover the required areas. The matched project is the given title, and generation time is current. Need to ensure the profile is realistic and matches the project needs.
