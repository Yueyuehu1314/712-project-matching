Okay, let's start by understanding the user's request. They want a student profile for a project titled "IoT-Based Spectral Sensing" in agriculture and environmental monitoring. The project requires skills in machine learning, web development, data science, cybersecurity, and networking. The student's basic info is provided: Morgan Taylor, Student ID n07590196, and several completed courses.

First, I need to match the academic background with the required skills. The major should be Software Development or Computer Science. The user listed "Software Development, Computer" as required majors, so I'll go with Software Development. The year level isn't specified, but since Morgan has completed several advanced courses, maybe third or fourth year.

Academic background needs to highlight relevant coursework and skills. The completed courses include software engineering, databases, cybersecurity, mobile app development, computer systems, OOP, systems analysis, and intro to programming. I should connect these to the project's needs. For example, IFN668 (Advanced Software Engineering) and IFN670 (Mobile Development) relate to software and IoT development. IFN623 (Cyber Security) is directly relevant. Data science skills might come from databases or systems courses, so I can mention data analysis projects. Networking could be part of computer systems or systems design.

Project experience: The user needs three projects. Let's think about IoT, web apps, and data analysis. Maybe a smart greenhouse project using sensors (IoT and data science), a secure web app (cybersecurity and web dev), and a mobile app for data collection. Each project should align with the required technical skills.

Work experience: Maybe an internship in software development with IoT or cybersecurity focus. Highlighting relevant tasks like developing secure systems or data analysis.

Interests should reflect tech areas relevant to the project: IoT, machine learning, cybersecurity, environmental tech, open-source contributions.

Technical skills need to include the required ones: machine learning, web dev (React, Node.js), data science (Python, SQL), cybersecurity (encryption, penetration testing), networking (TCP/IP, IoT protocols). Also, add relevant tools from courses like Git, Docker.

Now, structure all this into the markdown format. Ensure each section is concise and matches the project's needs. Check for consistency in the student's background and the project requirements. Make sure the profile is realistic and the student has the necessary skills without being overqualified. Avoid any markdown in the thinking process, but the final answer must follow the specified format.
