Okay, let's start by understanding the user's request. They need a student profile for a project titled "IoT-Based Spectral Sensing" in agriculture and environmental monitoring. The required majors are Software Development and Computer, with technical skills in machine learning, web development, data science, cybersecurity, and networking. The student provided is Devon Miller with specific courses.

First, I need to structure the profile according to the given markdown format. The basic info is already provided, so I'll fill in the name, ID, major, and year. The user mentioned the major as "Software Development," so I'll use that. For the year, since the courses are at an advanced level (like IFN668), it's likely a senior student, so maybe fourth year.

Next, the academic background. Devon's courses include Advanced Software Engineering, Databases, Cyber Security, Mobile App Development, etc. I need to weave these into a coherent academic description, highlighting relevant skills for the project. Emphasize experience with IoT, machine learning, and data analysis, as those are needed for the project.

Completed courses are listed, so I'll just list them as provided.

Project experience: The user wants three projects. The example projects should tie into IoT, machine learning, and web development. For instance, a previous IoT project using sensors, a machine learning model for data analysis, and a web application for data visualization. Each project should be around 50 words.

Work experience: Maybe a part-time job in IT or a related field, using cybersecurity or software development. Keep it concise, within 100 words.

Interests should align with the project's tech areas: IoT, AI, environmental tech, open-source projects, etc.

Technical skills need to include the required ones: machine learning, web dev, data science, cybersecurity, networking. Also, add relevant ones like Python, JavaScript, SQL, etc., based on the courses.

Matched project is given, so just fill in the title and current time.

Need to ensure all sections are filled, relevant to the project, and realistic. Avoid making up info not in the provided data, but build upon it. Check for consistency and that each part meets the project's requirements.
