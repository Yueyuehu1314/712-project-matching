Okay, let's start by understanding the user's request. They need a student profile for a project called "IoT-Based Spectral Sensing and..." which is in agriculture and environmental monitoring. The project requires skills in machine learning, web development, data science, cybersecurity, and networking. The student's name is Jordan Wright with a specific student ID and completed courses.

First, I need to determine the major. The required majors are Software Development and Computer. Since the courses listed include topics like software engineering, databases, cybersecurity, and mobile development, a major in Software Development makes sense. Maybe "Software Development and Cybersecurity" to cover both required skills.

Next, the academic background should highlight relevant courses. Jordan has taken advanced software engineering, databases, cybersecurity, mobile app development, computer systems fundamentals, object-oriented programming, systems analysis, and intro to programming. I should mention how these courses align with the project's needs, like IoT, data analysis, and security.

For project experience, the user mentioned three projects. Since the project is about IoT and spectral sensing, I need to create projects that relate. Maybe a smart agriculture system using IoT, a cybersecurity framework for IoT, and a mobile app for data visualization. Each project should tie into the required skills.

Work experience should be something related. Maybe an intern at a tech startup working on IoT and cybersecurity. That would give practical experience in the needed areas.

Interests should reflect the skills and project. Machine learning, IoT, environmental tech, cybersecurity, and data visualization. These align with the project's goals.

Technical skills need to include the required ones: machine learning, web dev, data science, cybersecurity, networking. Also, add relevant ones from the courses like Python, JavaScript, SQL, etc.

The student's name and ID are given. Year level could be 4th year as they have many advanced courses. Academic background should be 150-200 words, explaining how their courses prepare them for the project. Each project experience is around 50 words, so concise but informative.

I need to ensure all the information is in the correct markdown format without markdown. Also, the matched project title and generation time should be included. Let me check the example provided to make sure everything matches the structure. Avoid any markdown in the thinking process, just plain text. Finally, generate the profile following all the guidelines.
