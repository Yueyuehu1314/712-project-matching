Okay, let's start by understanding the user's request. They need a student profile for a project titled "Zero-Day Attack Detection Using..." which involves machine learning and cybersecurity. The student provided is Rory Brown with specific courses and an ID.

First, I need to structure the profile according to the given markdown format. The user emphasized strict adherence to the format, so I must ensure all sections are present. 

Looking at the project requirements, the required majors are Computer Science or Data Science. Rory's major should be Computer Science as per the courses listed. The year level isn't provided, but since he's taken advanced courses like IFN619 and IFN666, he's likely in his third or fourth year. I'll go with third year as a safe assumption.

Academic background should highlight relevant courses and skills. The completed courses include data analytics, advanced programming, cybersecurity, and web technologies. I'll connect these to the project needs, emphasizing machine learning and cybersecurity. For example, IFN619 (Data Analytics) is crucial for handling datasets, and IFN623 (Cyber Security) directly relates to the project's focus.

Project experience needs three entries. The user's project is about machine learning for zero-day attacks. So, I'll create projects that showcase unsupervised learning, network anomaly detection, and cybersecurity tools. For example, a project on network traffic analysis using clustering algorithms would fit.

Work experience should be brief, within 100 words. Since no actual experience is given, I'll invent a relevant internship, maybe in cybersecurity or data analysis. Mentioning tasks like data preprocessing and model evaluation aligns with the project's needs.

Technical skills must include machine learning, web development, data science, cybersecurity, etc. From the courses, skills like Python, TensorFlow, network protocols, and tools like Wireshark are relevant. Also, web technologies from IFN666 should be included.

Interests should reflect areas related to the project. Cybersecurity, AI ethics, network security, data visualization, and emerging tech are good fits.

Matching the project title and generation time at the end. Need to ensure the profile is realistic, so skills and courses must directly support the project's goals. Also, check that all sections are filled properly without markdown, just following the structure.
