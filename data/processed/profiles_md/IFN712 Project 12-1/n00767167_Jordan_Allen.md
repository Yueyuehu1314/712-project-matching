Okay, I need to create a student profile for Jordan Allen based on the given project requirements. Let me start by understanding the project. The project is about detecting zero-day attacks using machine learning, which involves cybersecurity, data science, and networking. The required majors are Computer Science or Data Science, and the technical skills include machine learning, web development, data science, cybersecurity, mobile development, and networking.

First, the basic information is provided: Jordan Allen, Student ID n00767167, with several courses listed. The major should probably be Computer Science or Data Science. Since the courses include Cyber Security and Data Analytics, maybe Computer Science with a focus on cybersecurity.

Next, the academic background. I need to connect the courses to the project. IFN623 Cyber Security covers network security and cryptography. IFN619 Data Analytics involves data visualization and statistical analysis. IFN666 Web Technologies relates to web development. IFN551 and IFN556 are programming courses. IFN555 and IFN552 are systems analysis and design. The academic background should highlight how these courses prepare Jordan for the project, especially in machine learning and cybersecurity.

Completed courses are already listed, so just need to format them correctly.

Project experience: Need three projects related to the skills. Maybe a machine learning project for anomaly detection, a web app for security monitoring, and a cybersecurity project analyzing network traffic. Each should be around 50 words.

Work experience: Should relate to the required skills. Maybe an internship in IT security, working on network monitoring tools. Mention using Python and machine learning for threat detection.

Interests: Should align with the project. Cybersecurity, machine learning, data visualization, ethical hacking, network protocols.

Technical skills: From the required skills: machine learning (scikit-learn, TensorFlow), Python, R, SQL, JavaScript, React, Node.js, cybersecurity tools (Wireshark, Nmap), networking protocols.

Matched project is the given one, with the current time.

I need to ensure that all the courses and experiences align with the project's requirements. Check that the technical skills cover machine learning, web dev, data science, cybersecurity, and networking. Make sure the projects are relevant. Also, the academic background should show progression in the necessary areas.

Let me structure the sections step by step, making sure each part meets the project's needs and the provided information.
