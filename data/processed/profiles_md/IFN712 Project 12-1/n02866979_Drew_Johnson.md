Okay, let's start by understanding the user's request. They need a student profile for Drew Johnson, with specific courses and the project on zero-day attack detection. The project requires skills in machine learning, cybersecurity, data science, etc.

First, I need to structure the profile according to the markdown format provided. The basic info is given, so I'll fill that in. Next, the academic background should highlight relevant courses and how they align with the project. Drew has taken courses in data analytics, cybersecurity, and programming, which are all relevant.

For the completed courses list, I'll use the provided course names. Then, project experience needs three projects. The user mentioned the project is about machine learning for zero-day detection, so I should create projects that reflect experience in ML, cybersecurity, and data analysis. For example, a network anomaly detection project using ML, a cybersecurity simulation, and a data visualization project.

Work experience should be brief but relevant. Maybe an internship in cybersecurity or data analysis. Interests should include cybersecurity, machine learning, etc. Technical skills need to cover the required areas: Python, machine learning libraries, network protocols, etc.

I need to ensure all sections are filled out, keeping descriptions concise and within word limits. Also, check that the matched project title and time are included. Let me make sure everything aligns with the project requirements and the student's courses. Avoid any markdown and use the correct structure. Let me review each section again for consistency and relevance.
