Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants a student profile for Rowan Moore with specific courses and a project related to zero-day attack detection using machine learning. The required majors are Computer Science and Data Science, and technical skills include machine learning, web development, data science, cybersecurity, mobile development, networking. 

First, the basic info is given, so I'll just input that. For the academic background, I need to connect his courses to the project. He has IFN564 Machine Learning, which is directly relevant. IFN623 Cyber Security and IFN553 Networking cover the cybersecurity and networking aspects. IFN632 and IFN19 are data analytics courses, which tie into data science. 

Next, completed courses should list all the provided ones. Project experience needs three projects related to the required skills. Maybe a machine learning project on anomaly detection, a cybersecurity project on intrusion detection, and a data analytics project. 

Work experience could be internships in cybersecurity or data analysis. Interests should align with the technical skills, like cybersecurity, machine learning, etc. Technical skills need to cover all the required areas: machine learning, Python, network protocols, etc.

I need to ensure that each section matches the project requirements. The academic background should highlight how his courses prepare him for the project. The projects should demonstrate hands-on experience in relevant areas. Work experience adds practical skills. Technical skills should list all the required ones. Make sure the matched project title and time are included. Also, the generation time is current, so maybe use a placeholder like [Current Time]. Check for realistic details and avoid markdown in the thinking process.
