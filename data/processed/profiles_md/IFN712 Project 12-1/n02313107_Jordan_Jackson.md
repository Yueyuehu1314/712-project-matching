Okay, let's tackle this student profile generation. The user provided a project on zero-day attack detection using machine learning. The required majors are Computer Science and Data Science, and the technical skills include machine learning, web dev, data science, cybersecurity, mobile dev, and networking.

First, the student's name is Jordan Jackson, ID n02313107. The completed courses listed include IFN564 Machine Learning, IFN554 Databases, IFN623 Cyber Security, etc. I need to create an academic background that highlights these courses and how they relate to the project. Jordan is likely a 3rd-year student since they have taken advanced courses.

For the academic background, I should mention their focus on machine learning and cybersecurity, along with data analytics courses. The project experience needs three projects related to the required skills. Maybe a machine learning project for network traffic, a cybersecurity simulation, and a data analytics project. Work experience could involve internships in cybersecurity or data analysis. Interests should align with tech areas like AI, cybersecurity, etc. Technical skills need to include Python, machine learning frameworks, network protocols, etc. Make sure all sections are concise and meet the word limits. Check that the matched project is correctly titled and the time is current.
