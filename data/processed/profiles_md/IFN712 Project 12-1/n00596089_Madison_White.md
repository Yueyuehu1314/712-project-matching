Okay, let's tackle this query step by step. The user wants a student profile for Madison White that matches the project on zero-day attack detection using machine learning. First, I need to make sure all the required sections are included and formatted correctly in markdown.

Starting with the basic information, the name and student ID are given. The major should be Computer Science or Data Science. The project requires cybersecurity and data science skills, so choosing Computer Science with a minor in Data Science makes sense.

Next, the academic background. The student has completed courses in data analytics, advanced programming, computer systems, web technologies, cyber security, and programming. I need to highlight how these courses relate to the project. For example, IFN619 (Data Analytics) is relevant for data processing and visualization, IFN666 (Web Technologies) for web development skills, and IFN623 (Cyber Security) directly ties into the project's cybersecurity aspect.

Completed courses are listed, so I just need to present them in a bullet format as specified.

Project experience should showcase relevant projects. The user mentioned three projects. I'll think of three examples that align with the project's requirements. For instance, a machine learning model for network traffic analysis, a cybersecurity threat detection system, and a web-based dashboard for security analytics. Each project needs a brief description linking to the skills required.

Work experience should be concise, within 100 words. Mentioning internships or roles related to cybersecurity and data analysis would fit. For example, an internship at a cybersecurity firm and a data analyst role at a tech startup.

Interests should reflect areas relevant to the project. Cybersecurity, machine learning, data visualization, network security, and ethical hacking are good choices.

Technical skills need to cover machine learning, web development, data science, cybersecurity, networking, etc. Skills like Python, TensorFlow, Keras, SQL, Django, Flask, Wireshark, Nmap, etc., would be appropriate.

The matched project is given, and the generation time should be the current date and time. I'll use a placeholder like [Current Time] as per the user's instruction.

I need to ensure all the technical skills and courses align with the project's requirements. Also, the academic background should mention how the courses prepare the student for the project. Avoid any markdown in the thinking process, but the final answer must be in the specified markdown format.

Let me check if all the required sections are covered and that the content is realistic. The name is Madison White, student ID n00596089. The academic background should tie the courses to the project's machine learning and cybersecurity aspects. The project experiences should demonstrate hands-on experience in relevant areas. The work experience and interests should further reinforce the student's suitability for the project.
