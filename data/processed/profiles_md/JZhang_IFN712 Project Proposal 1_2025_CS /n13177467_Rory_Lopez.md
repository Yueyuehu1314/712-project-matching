Okay, let's tackle this student profile generation. The user provided detailed project info and the student's basic info. The project is a literature review on diabetes complications using medical imaging data, focusing on heart, foot, and retinal images. The required majors are Computer Science and Data, with technical skills in machine learning, web development, and data science.

First, the student's name is Rory Lopez with the given student ID. Completed courses include several relevant ones like Machine Learning (IFN564) and Web Technologies (IFN666). I need to align these courses with the project requirements. For example, IFN564 is crucial for machine learning, which is required. The project also needs data science skills, so mentioning databases (IFN554) and systems analysis (IFN552) makes sense.

Next, the academic background should reflect a focus on computer science with data analytics. Highlighting courses in machine learning, algorithms, and databases would show the right foundation. The student should have a strong grasp of programming and data analysis.

Project experience should include relevant projects. The user mentioned three projects. Let's think of ones that involve machine learning and data analysis. Maybe a diabetes prediction model using machine learning, a web app for medical imaging, and an image segmentation project. These would directly relate to the project's focus areas.

Work experience could be an internship in data analytics where the student worked on healthcare datasets. This connects to the project's need for analyzing medical data.

Technical skills need to cover machine learning (Python, TensorFlow), web development (React, Node.js), data science (Pandas, SQL), and image processing (OpenCV). Including these shows the necessary technical abilities.

Interests might include healthcare tech, data visualization, etc., which align with the project's goals. 

I need to ensure all sections are filled according to the markdown format, using the user's provided info and expanding it to meet the project's requirements. Also, making sure the matched project title is correct and the generation time is current but in the format the user expects. Let me check the word counts for academic background and project descriptions to stay within limits. Avoid any markdown in the thinking process, but the final answer must follow the specified markdown.
