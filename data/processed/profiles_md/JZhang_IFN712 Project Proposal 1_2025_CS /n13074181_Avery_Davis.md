Okay, let's start by understanding the user's request. They want a student profile for a project on diabetes complications using medical imaging data. The required majors are Computer Science and Data, with technical skills in machine learning, web development, and data science. The student's name is Avery Davis with specific courses listed.

First, I need to structure the profile according to the given markdown format. The basic info is provided, so I'll fill that in. For the academic background, I should connect their courses to the project requirements. Avery has taken courses like Machine Learning, Advanced Programming, and Web Technologies, which align well with the project's needs. I'll emphasize how these courses have prepared them for handling data and building systems.

Next, the completed courses list is already given, so I just need to format them correctly. For project experience, I need to create three relevant projects. Maybe a diabetes prediction model using ML, a web-based image analysis tool, and a data pipeline for medical imaging. Each project should be concise and relate to the technical skills mentioned.

Work experience should show relevant internships. Perhaps a data analyst internship where they used Python and SQL, and a web developer role where they built dashboards. This ties in their technical skills with real-world experience.

Interests should reflect a passion for health tech and data science. Technical skills need to include machine learning, Python, web dev frameworks, databases, etc., aligning with the project's requirements. Finally, ensure the matched project title and generation time are included. I'll check that all sections are covered and the content is realistic and relevant to the project.
