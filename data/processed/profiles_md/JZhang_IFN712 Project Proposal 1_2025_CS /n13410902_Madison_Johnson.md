Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants a student profile for Madison Johnson based on the given project info and courses. First, I need to make sure I understand the project. It's a literature review on diabetes complications using medical imaging data, focusing on heart, foot, and retinal images. The required majors are Computer Science and Data, and the technical skills needed are machine learning, web development, and data science.

The student's completed courses include several relevant ones like Machine Learning (IFN564), which is directly required. Also, Web Technologies (IFN666) and Object Oriented Programming (IFN556) are there. I should highlight these courses to show alignment with the project's technical needs.

The academic background needs to be 150-200 words. I should mention her major in Computer Science with a Data Science specialization, her coursework in ML, algorithms, databases, etc. Also, her project experiences should tie into medical imaging or data analysis. Maybe create a project where she used ML for image analysis, which is relevant to the diabetes project.

For project experiences, I need three examples. Let's think: one could be a diabetes-related ML project, another on web app for medical data, and another on analyzing retinal images. These would directly relate to the project's focus areas.

Work experience should be brief, maybe an internship where she applied data science or ML. Interests should include health informatics, data visualization, etc. Technical skills list should include Python, TensorFlow, SQL, React, etc., aligning with the required skills.

I need to ensure all sections are filled properly. Check the format strictly. Also, the matched project title and generation time. Let me structure each section step by step, making sure to connect her background and skills to the project requirements.
