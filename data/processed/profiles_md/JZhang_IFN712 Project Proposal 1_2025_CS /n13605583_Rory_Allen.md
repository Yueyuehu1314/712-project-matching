Okay, let's start by understanding the user's request. They need a student profile for a project focused on diabetes-related complications using medical imaging data. The required majors are Computer Science and Data, and the technical skills include machine learning, web development, and data science.

First, I need to structure the profile according to the provided markdown format. The basic information is given: Rory Allen, student ID n13605583, major in Computer Science, and the year level. Since the project is in data and computer science, I should assume a senior year, maybe 3rd or 4th year.

For the academic background, I need to connect Rory's studies to the project. Courses like Machine Learning (IFN564) and Algorithms are relevant. I should mention coursework in data analysis, programming, and systems design. Also, the databases course (IFN554) is important for handling medical imaging data.

Completed courses are listed, so I'll include those. The project experience needs to be three projects. Let's think of projects related to machine learning and medical data. Maybe a previous project on diabetic retinopathy detection using CNNs. Another could be a predictive model for foot ulcers using Python. A third might involve a web app for displaying medical images, using React or similar frameworks.

Work experience should show relevant internships. Perhaps a data analyst intern at a healthcare startup, working on predictive models using Python and SQL. That ties in data science and machine learning.

Interests should align with the project. Medical imaging, machine learning, data visualization, health tech, and diabetes research. Technical skills need to include the required ones: Python, R, TensorFlow, React, SQL, etc. Also, mention tools like Git and Jupyter for collaboration and analysis.

The matched project is the literature review on diabetes complications. The student's skills in machine learning and data analysis are perfect for analyzing imaging data correlations. Web development skills can help in creating interfaces for data visualization.

I need to ensure all sections are filled out correctly, with realistic details that match the project's needs. Check that the courses and projects directly relate to the required skills. Avoid any markdown and keep the thinking process natural.
