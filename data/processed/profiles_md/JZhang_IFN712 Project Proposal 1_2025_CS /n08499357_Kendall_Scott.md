Okay, let me start by understanding the user's request. They want a student profile for a project that's a comprehensive literature review on diabetes complications using medical imaging data. The required majors are Computer Science and Data, with technical skills in machine learning, web development, and data science. The student's name and ID are given, along with completed courses.

First, I need to make sure the major aligns. The user mentioned "Computer Science and Data," so I'll use "Computer Science and Data Analytics" as the major. The year level should be appropriate for someone who has completed several courses. The courses listed are mostly in programming, machine learning, algorithms, and web tech. The student should be in their third year, maybe, since they have a good number of courses under their belt.

Next, the academic background needs to highlight relevant coursework and skills. The student should have a strong foundation in programming, data analysis, and machine learning. Mentioning projects related to medical data or image processing would be good. For example, a project on analyzing diabetic retinopathy images using ML would tie in directly with the project's focus.

Completed courses are provided, so I'll list those. Then, project experience should include examples that mirror the project's requirements. Maybe a literature review on machine learning in healthcare, a web app for data visualization, and a project analyzing foot ulcers with image processing. Each project should be around 50 words, concise but descriptive.

Work experience could involve an internship in a healthcare data analytics company, applying machine learning to patient data. Interests should include things like healthcare tech, data visualization, etc. Technical skills should cover Python, machine learning frameworks, web dev tools, SQL, etc.

I need to ensure all the technical skills required (machine learning, web dev, data science) are included. The matched project should be the one provided, and generation time is current. Also, the name and student ID are given, so those are fixed. Let me structure all this into the markdown format as specified, keeping each section within the word limits. Let me double-check that the courses and projects align with the project's focus on diabetes complications and medical imaging.
