Okay, let's start by understanding the user's request. They need a student profile for a project focused on a literature review analyzing diabetes complications using medical imaging data. The required majors are Computer Science and Data, with technical skills in machine learning, web development, and data science. The student provided is Reese Hernandez with specific completed courses.

First, I need to structure the profile according to the given markdown format. The basic info is already provided, so I'll fill in the name, student ID, major, and year. Since the project is in Computer Science and Data, the major should reflect that. The year level could be a senior or final year student, as they're likely to have completed relevant courses.

Next, the academic background. Reese has taken courses in programming, machine learning, algorithms, systems analysis, web technologies, advanced programming, databases, and intro to programming. I need to highlight how these courses prepare them for the project. For example, machine learning is directly relevant for correlation analysis, and web technologies might be for presenting findings. Databases are important for handling medical imaging data.

Completed courses are listed, so I'll include those as provided. Project experience should tie into the skills needed. The user mentioned diabetes complications and medical imaging. I can create projects like a predictive model for diabetic retinopathy using ML, a web app for analyzing foot ulcers, and a cardiovascular analysis tool using image processing. Each project should be around 50 words, showing application of relevant skills.

Work experience should be brief, within 100 words. Maybe an internship in data analysis or healthcare tech. Interests should include things related to the project, like medical imaging, data science, public health, etc. Technical skills need to cover machine learning, web dev, data science tools. Python, TensorFlow, SQL, React, etc.

I need to make sure the profile is realistic. The student should have a solid foundation in both computer science and data science. The projects should demonstrate practical application of their coursework. Technical skills should align with the project's requirements. Also, the matched project title and generation time should be included at the end.

Let me check if all required sections are covered. Basic info, academic background, completed courses, project experience, work experience, interests, technical skills, and matched project. Yes. Now, I'll draft each section with the appropriate details, ensuring relevance to the project. Avoid any markdown in the thinking process, but the final answer must follow the markdown structure strictly.
