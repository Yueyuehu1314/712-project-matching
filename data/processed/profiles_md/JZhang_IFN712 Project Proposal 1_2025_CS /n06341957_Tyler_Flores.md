Okay, let's start by looking at the project requirements. The project is a comprehensive literature review focusing on diabetes-related complications using medical imaging data from the heart, foot, and retina. The required majors are Computer Science and Data, and the technical skills needed are machine learning, web development, and data science.

First, the student's name is Tyler Flores, Student ID n06341957. The completed courses include several relevant ones like Machine Learning (IFN564), which is directly related. I need to make sure the academic background ties into data science and computer science with a focus on machine learning and data analysis.

For the academic background, I should mention coursework in algorithms, machine learning, and databases. Maybe highlight projects or coursework that involved data analysis or medical imaging. Since the project is a literature review, the student should have experience in research methods or data synthesis.

Project experience should reflect handling data, maybe previous projects in machine learning or web apps that process data. For example, a diabetes prediction model using machine learning, a web app for medical data visualization, or an image analysis project. Each project should be around 50 words, so concise but informative.

Work experience could involve internships in data analysis or tech roles where they applied their skills. Maybe a data analyst intern at a healthcare company using Python for data processing.

Technical skills need to include machine learning (like Python, TensorFlow), web development (HTML, JavaScript, React), data science (Pandas, NumPy), and databases (SQL, MongoDB). Also, mention tools like Git and Jupyter Notebooks.

Interests should align with the project, such as healthcare tech, data visualization, medical imaging, AI ethics, and public health. 

Make sure the matched project title is correctly filled and the generation time is current. Check that all sections are filled according to the format, with the right word counts and structure. Avoid markdown in the thinking process, but the final answer must be in the specified markdown format.
