Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants a student profile for a project on diabetes-related complications using medical imaging data. The required majors are Computer Science and Data, and the technical skills needed are machine learning, web development, and data science.

First, the student's name is Logan Lee with a given student ID. The completed courses are listed, so I need to make sure those are included. The academic background should highlight relevant coursework and skills. Since the project involves machine learning and data analysis, I should mention courses like Machine Learning and Algorithms. Also, web development is required, so the Web Technologies course is important.

For the academic background, maybe start with Logan's major and year. They're in their third year, which is typical for someone with these courses. Mention their focus on data science and machine learning, and how their coursework in databases and programming prepares them for handling medical imaging data.

Completed courses are provided, so I'll list those exactly as given.

Project experiences should align with the project. Maybe create a project where they used machine learning for medical image analysis, another on web development for a data platform, and a third on diabetic retinopathy analysis. Each project should be brief but relevant.

Work experience could involve an internship where they worked on data analysis or machine learning projects. Maybe at a health tech startup, which ties into the medical aspect.

Interests should include things like medical imaging, machine learning, data visualization, healthcare tech, and diabetes research. Technical skills should cover Python, R, SQL, TensorFlow, Flask, Django, Git, and data visualization tools. These align with the required skills and the project's needs.

Make sure the matched project title is the one provided, and the generation time is current. Check that all sections are filled properly without markdown, just the content in the correct format. Avoid any extra text and ensure the profile is realistic and matches the project requirements.
