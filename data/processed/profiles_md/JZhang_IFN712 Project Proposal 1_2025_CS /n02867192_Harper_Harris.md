Okay, let's start by looking at the project requirements. The project is a comprehensive literature review on diabetes complications using medical imaging data, focusing on heart, foot, and retinal images. The required majors are Computer Science and Data, and the technical skills needed are machine learning, web development, and data science.

First, I need to create a student profile for Harper Harris with the given student ID. The major should be Computer Science with a Data Science specialization. The year level should probably be a senior year, like 3rd or 4th year, to have the necessary experience.

Academic background needs to show a focus on data science and machine learning. The completed courses provided include machine learning, web technologies, algorithms, databases, etc., which align well. I should mention courses like Machine Learning (IFN564) and Algorithms and Complexity (IFN563) to highlight their relevance.

Project experience should include projects related to medical imaging and data analysis. Maybe a project on diabetic retinopathy detection using CNNs, a cardiovascular disease prediction model with SVMs, and a diabetic foot ulcer segmentation using U-Net. These directly relate to the project's focus areas.

Work experience could be an internship in health informatics where they developed a web-based EHR system, which ties in web development and data science. 

Technical skills need to include machine learning algorithms, web development frameworks, data science tools, and image processing. Python, TensorFlow, React, SQL, OpenCV, etc., would be relevant.

Interests should reflect a passion for healthcare tech, AI in diagnostics, open-source contributions, hiking, and reading medical journals. 

Make sure the matched project title is correctly filled and the generation time is the current time. Check all the sections to ensure they align with the project's needs and the provided courses.
