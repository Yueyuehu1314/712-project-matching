Okay, I need to generate a student profile for the Smart Intersection Localization project. Let me start by understanding the project requirements. The project is about using BLE technology to improve safety for VRUs at intersections. The required majors are Software Development and Computer, and the technical skills needed are machine learning, web development, data science, cybersecurity, mobile development, networking.

The user provided Harper Garcia's basic info, including completed courses. I need to make sure the academic background and experiences align with these courses and the project's technical skills.

First, the academic background should mention relevant courses. Harper has courses in security, databases, computer systems, cybersecurity, software engineering, and programming. I should highlight how these courses prepare them for the project. For example, IFN553 covers networking, which is needed for BLE technology. IFN623 Cyber Security is directly relevant. The courses in programming and software engineering are important for development tasks.

Project experience should reflect the technical skills. Maybe create a project on a BLE-based asset tracker, which relates to the project's use of BLE. Another project could be a web app using React and Node.js for web development. A cybersecurity project involving encryption and secure protocols would tie into the security aspect required.

Work experience should show relevant skills. Maybe an internship where Harper worked on secure mobile apps or networked systems.

Technical skills need to list the required ones: machine learning, web dev, data science, etc. Also, include skills from the courses like Python, Java, SQL, cybersecurity tools.

Interests should align with the project's focus, like IoT, smart cities, privacy tech.

I need to make sure all sections connect to the project. The matched project title is given, and generation time is the current date. Let me structure each section with the right details, keeping descriptions concise but relevant.
