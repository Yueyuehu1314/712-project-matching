Okay, I need to create a student profile for Finley Lopez based on the given project requirements. Let me start by looking at the project details. The project is about Smart Intersection Localization using BLE technology. The required majors are Software Development and Computer, so Finley's major should be something like Computer Science or Software Engineering.

The technical skills needed are machine learning, web development, data science, cybersecurity, mobile development, and networking. I need to ensure Finley's skills cover these areas. The completed courses listed include networking, databases, programming, cybersecurity, and software engineering. I should connect these courses to the required skills. For example, IFN553 is about security and networking, which ties into cybersecurity and networking skills. IFN623 is Cyber Security, which directly covers cybersecurity. 

Academic background should mention relevant coursework and how it prepares Finley for the project. Maybe mention projects where he applied machine learning or worked on web/mobile apps. 

Project experience needs three entries. Each should relate to the required skills. For example, a BLE-based pedestrian tracking project for machine learning and networking. A secure web app for cybersecurity and web dev. A mobile app for location-based alerts involving mobile development and data science.

Work experience should show practical application. Maybe an internship where he developed secure software or worked on IoT projects. 

Interests should align with the project's tech stack, like BLE, IoT, cybersecurity, etc. Technical skills list should include all the required ones. 

I need to make sure the profile matches the project's needs and that Finley's background and skills are realistic. Also, check the markdown format strictly. Let me structure each section accordingly without missing any parts.
