Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants a student profile for the Smart Intersection Localization project. The project uses BLE tech to improve safety for VRUs. The required majors are Software Development and Computer, and the skills needed are machine learning, web dev, data science, cybersecurity, mobile dev, networking.

First, the student's name is Morgan Allen, ID n16212621. Completed courses include networking, databases, computer systems, cybersecurity, advanced software engineering, programming, OOP, and systems analysis. Need to map these courses to the required skills.

Academic background should highlight relevant coursework and how it aligns with the project. For example, IFN553 (Networking) and IFN623 (Cybersecurity) cover networking and security aspects. IFN554 Databases and data science skills go together. Programming courses (IFN555, IFN556) relate to software development. Advanced Software Engineering (IFN668) ties into web and mobile dev.

Project experience needs three examples. Maybe a BLE-based location tracking project for machine learning and networking. A secure web app using cybersecurity and web dev. A mobile app for VRU monitoring involving mobile dev and data science.

Work experience should show relevant industry experience, maybe internships in cybersecurity or software development.

Interests should include tech areas related to the project, like IoT, cybersecurity, machine learning.

Technical skills list should cover all required areas: machine learning, web dev (React, Node.js), data science (Python, SQL), cybersecurity, mobile dev (Flutter), networking, BLE, etc.

Make sure the matched project title is correct and generation time is current. Check that all elements are in the markdown format specified.
