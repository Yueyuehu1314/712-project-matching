Okay, let me start by understanding the user's request. They need a student profile for a project called "AI-Driven Project-Student" which focuses on matching research projects with researchers using AI, especially in environments with uncertain data. The required majors are Software Development and Computer, and the technical skills needed are web development, data science, and cybersecurity. 

First, the student's name is River Garcia, Student ID n10531344. The courses they've taken include several related to databases, security, programming, software engineering, systems analysis, OOP, computer systems, and cybersecurity. I need to make sure these courses are listed under Completed Courses.

Next, the Academic Background should highlight their major in Software Development with a minor in Computer Science. Since the project involves AI and data challenges, I should mention their coursework in databases, cybersecurity, and software engineering. Maybe also note their thesis on adaptive algorithms for uncertain data, which directly relates to the project's focus.

For Project Experience, the user provided three projects. The first is a project management platform using React and Node.js with MongoDB. The second is a cybersecurity tool for intrusion detection with Python and machine learning. The third is a secure cloud-based collaboration system using Docker and Kubernetes. Each of these should be concise, around 50 words.

Work Experience should be within 100 words. Maybe an internship at a tech startup where they worked on data pipelines and security protocols, which ties into the required skills.

Interests need to include relevant areas like AI, cybersecurity, etc. Technical Skills should cover the required ones plus others like Python, SQL, etc., to make it comprehensive.

I need to ensure that the profile aligns with the project's need for handling uncertain data, AI methods, and the technical skills mentioned. Also, the matched project title and generation time should be at the end. Let me structure all this into the required markdown format without any markdown, just plain text with the correct sections.
