Okay, let's start by understanding the user's request. They need a student profile for a project titled "AI-Driven Project-Student" that matches research projects with researchers without relying on labeled datasets. The required majors are Software Development and Computer, and the technical skills needed are web development, data science, and cybersecurity.

First, the student's name is Riley Johnson with a given Student ID. The completed courses are listed, so I need to incorporate those into the profile. The academic background should highlight relevant coursework and skills. For example, courses like IFN554 Databases and IFN668 Advanced Software Engineering are crucial for data handling and software development, which are key for the project.

Next, the project experience needs three brief descriptions. Since the project involves AI and data science, I should mention projects that utilize machine learning and data analysis. Maybe a project on predictive analytics using Python and machine learning libraries. Another could be a secure web application using cybersecurity principles. A third might involve designing a scalable database system, which ties into the databases course.

Work experience should show practical application. Maybe an internship in cybersecurity or a role where they developed web applications. It needs to be concise but relevant.

Technical skills need to include web dev (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React), data science (Python, SQL, Pandas, Scikit-learn), and cybersecurity (encryption, network security, ethical hacking). Also, mention software engineering tools like Git and Agile.

Interests should align with the project's focus, like AI, data privacy, and secure systems. Also, include collaborative problem-solving to show teamwork.

The academic background should tie together the courses and how they relate to the project. Emphasize skills in software engineering, data science, and cybersecurity. Mention experience with databases and security protocols, which are directly relevant.

Need to make sure all sections are filled out as per the markdown format. Check that the matched project title and generation time are included. Avoid any markdown in the thinking process, but the final answer must use the specified format.

Also, ensure the profile is realistic. For example, a student in their third year with courses in programming, databases, security, and software engineering. The project experience should reflect hands-on learning related to the required skills. The work experience could be an internship or part-time job relevant to the field.

Finally, review everything to make sure it meets the project's requirements and the user's specifications. Check for consistency in the student's background and how well it aligns with the project's challenges, like handling uncertain data volumes and developing secure systems without labeled datasets.
