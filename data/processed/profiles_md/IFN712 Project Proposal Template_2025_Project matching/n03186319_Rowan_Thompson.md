Okay, let's start by understanding the user's request. They need a student profile for a project titled "AI-Driven Project-Student" that matches specific requirements. The project deals with matching research projects with researchers without relying on fully-labeled datasets. The required majors are Software Development and Computer Science, and technical skills include web development, data science, and cybersecurity.

First, I need to structure the profile using the provided markdown format. The student's name is Rowan Thompson with a given student ID. The completed courses list is provided, so I need to incorporate those. The major should be Software Development or a related field. The year level is probably a senior since they have several advanced courses.

Next, the academic background should reflect relevant coursework and skills. The user mentioned courses like databases, cybersecurity, programming, etc. I should highlight how these courses relate to the project's needs. For example, IFN554 Databases is relevant for data management, IFN623 Cyber Security ties into the cybersecurity skill requirement.

Project experience needs to be concise, around 50 words each. The projects should demonstrate skills in data science, web development, and cybersecurity. Maybe a project on secure data matching, a web app for project collaboration, and an AI-driven cybersecurity tool.

Work experience should be brief but relevant. Perhaps an internship in a tech company focusing on data security or software development.

Interests should align with the project's technical areas: machine learning, cybersecurity, data privacy, etc. Technical skills need to include the required ones plus others like Python, SQL, etc.

I need to ensure the profile is realistic and the student's background matches the project's challenges, like handling uncertain data and developing matching algorithms without labeled datasets. Also, mention any soft skills like problem-solving and collaboration.

Check that all sections are filled correctly, using the required format. Avoid markdown in the thinking process, but the final answer must use the markdown structure. Make sure the matched project title and generation time are included at the end.
