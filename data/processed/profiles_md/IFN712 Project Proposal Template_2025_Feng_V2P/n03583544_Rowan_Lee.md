Okay, let's start by looking at the project requirements. The project is about a smartphone-based real-time V2P system to help vulnerable road users. The required majors are Software Development and Computer, and the technical skills needed are web development, data science, cybersecurity, mobile development, database, and networking.

First, I need to create a student profile that matches these requirements. The user provided Rowan Lee with specific student ID and completed courses. The courses listed are relevant, so I should highlight how each course contributes to the necessary skills.

For the academic background, I should mention that Rowan is a 3rd-year Software Development major with a focus on mobile and web technologies. Including their coursework in databases, cybersecurity, and networking will align with the project's needs. It's important to note their hands-on experience in developing secure and scalable applications.

In the completed courses section, I need to list the provided courses. Then, for project experience, I should create 3 projects that showcase the required skills. Maybe a mobile app for traffic alerts, a secure web platform for data analytics, and a networked system for real-time data. Each project should be around 50 words, so I'll need to be concise but specific about the technologies used.

Work experience could involve an internship where Rowan worked on secure mobile applications, using React Native and Node.js. This ties into mobile development and cybersecurity. 

Interests should reflect relevant areas like IoT, cybersecurity, and data science. Technical skills need to cover all the required areas: web dev, mobile dev, databases, networking, data science, cybersecurity, etc. 

Finally, ensure the matched project is correctly titled and the generation time is current. Check that all sections are in the correct markdown format without any markdown in the thinking process. Avoid any extra information beyond the profile. Make sure everything is in English and the content is realistic and matches the project's needs.
