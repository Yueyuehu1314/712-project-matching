Okay, let's start by understanding the user's request. They need a student profile for a project called Smartphone-Based Real-Time V2P. The project focuses on improving safety for vulnerable road users through real-time communication between roadside infrastructure and smartphones. The required majors are Software Development and Computer, and the technical skills needed include web development, data science, cybersecurity, mobile development, database, and networking.

First, I'll look at the provided student information: Devon Lee, Student ID n14421494, with courses like Web Technologies, Databases, Security and Networking, Mobile App Development, etc. The courses align well with the technical skills required. I need to make sure that the academic background and project experience reflect these courses and the project's needs.

For the academic background, I should mention relevant coursework that ties into the project. Courses in web tech, databases, mobile development, security, and software engineering are key. I'll highlight how these courses prepare Devon for the project, like understanding real-time systems and secure communication.

Next, project experience. The user provided three example projects. I need to create three relevant ones. Maybe a mobile app for real-time alerts, a secure communication system, and a data visualization dashboard. Each project should be around 50 words, showing direct application of the required skills.

Work experience should be concise. Maybe an internship at a tech company working on similar technologies. Interests should include things like IoT, cybersecurity, etc., which are relevant. Technical skills need to list all the required ones, maybe adding some extras like Python, SQL, etc., based on the courses.

I need to ensure the profile is realistic. For example, a third-year student with these courses makes sense. The matched project title and generation time should be included at the end. Also, check the word counts for each section to meet the user's specifications. Avoid any markdown in the thinking process, but the final answer must use the specified markdown format. Let me structure all this into the required sections.
