Okay, let's start by looking at the project requirements. The project is about developing a smartphone-based real-time V2P (Vehicle-to-Pedestrian) system to enhance safety for vulnerable road users. The key areas here are real-time communication, mobile development, and integration with existing systems. The required majors are Software Development and Computer-related, and the technical skills needed include web development, data science, cybersecurity, mobile development, databases, and networking.

Now, the student's name is Rory Wright with a specific student ID. The completed courses listed include Web Technologies, Databases, Security and Networking, Mobile App Development, Object-Oriented Programming, Advanced Software Engineering, Systems Analysis and Design, and Intro to Programming. I need to ensure the academic background and project experience align with these courses and the project's technical skills.

First, the academic background should highlight relevant coursework. Rory's courses cover web, mobile, databases, security, networking, and software engineering. I should mention how these courses provide a foundation for the project. For example, IFN666 Web Technologies relates to web development, IFN670 to mobile development, IFN554 to databases, and IFN553 to networking and cybersecurity.

Next, project experience needs to be three projects that mirror the project's requirements. Possible project names could be "Real-Time Traffic Alert App," "Secure Data Exchange Platform," and "Smart Intersection Simulator." Each should tie into the required skills. The first project could involve mobile development and real-time data, the second cybersecurity and data science, and the third networking and simulation.

Work experience should be brief, maybe an internship related to software development or cybersecurity. Interests should include tech-related hobbies that complement the project, like mobile app development, cybersecurity, IoT, etc. Technical skills should list the required areas: web dev, mobile dev, databases, networking, cybersecurity, data science, OOP, and systems design.

I need to ensure all elements are covered in the specified markdown format without markdown. Also, the matched project title and generation time should be included. Let me check each section for alignment with the project's needs and the provided courses. Make sure the academic background is 150-200 words, each project description around 50 words, and work experience within 100 words. Avoid any markdown in the final answer as per instructions.
