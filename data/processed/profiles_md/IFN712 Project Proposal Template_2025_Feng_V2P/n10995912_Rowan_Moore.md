Okay, let's start by looking at the project requirements. The project is about a smartphone-based real-time V2P system to improve safety for vulnerable road users. The required majors are Software Development and Computer, with technical skills in web development, data science, cybersecurity, mobile development, database, and networking. The student's name is Rowan Moore with a specific student ID and a list of completed courses.

First, I need to create a realistic academic background that ties the completed courses to the project. The courses include web tech, databases, security, mobile dev, etc., so Rowan should have a major in Software Development. The academic background should mention relevant projects and how the courses apply to the project's needs.

Next, project experience. The user provided three placeholders. I should come up with three projects that use the skills from the courses. For example, a mobile app for traffic alerts would use mobile development and cybersecurity. A web-based dashboard for traffic data would involve web technologies and databases. Maybe a cybersecurity project related to network security.

Work experience should be brief, maybe an internship where Rowan worked on mobile apps or web development. Interests should align with tech, like open-source projects or IoT. Technical skills need to cover all the required areas: web dev, data science, cybersecurity, mobile dev, databases, networking. Also, maybe add some relevant tools like Python, React Native, etc.

Make sure the matched project is the given title and generation time. Need to check that all the courses are listed correctly and the skills match the project needs. Avoid any markdown in the thinking process, but the final answer must be in the specified markdown format. Also, ensure the academic background is 150-200 words, project experiences around 50 words each, and work experience under 100 words. Let me piece this together step by step, ensuring all requirements are met and the profile is cohesive.
