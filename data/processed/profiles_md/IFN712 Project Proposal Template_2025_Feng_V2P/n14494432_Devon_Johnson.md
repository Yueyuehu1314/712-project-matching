Okay, let's start by understanding the user's request. They need a student profile for a project titled "Smartphone-Based Real-Time V2P." The project aims to improve safety for vulnerable road users through real-time communication between infrastructure and smartphones. The required majors are Software Development and Computer, and technical skills include web dev, data science, cybersecurity, mobile dev, databases, networking.

First, the student's name is Devon Johnson with a given student ID. The completed courses are listed, so I need to map these courses to the required skills. For example, IFN670 Mobile Application Development would cover mobile development, IFN666 Web Technologies for web dev, IFN553 for networking and security. 

Next, the academic background should highlight relevant coursework and skills. I need to mention each course and how it contributes to the project. For instance, Web Technologies and Mobile Development show proficiency in building apps, Databases for managing data, Security and Networking for cybersecurity aspects. 

Project experience should reflect real-time systems, mobile apps, and data analysis. Maybe a mobile app for real-time data, a secure web app, and a data analytics project. Work experience could involve internships in software development or cybersecurity, applying those skills in real-world scenarios.

Technical skills need to list the required ones: web dev, mobile dev, databases, networking, cybersecurity, data science, etc. Also, programming languages like Java, Python, SQL, and tools like React Native, TensorFlow. 

Interests should align with the project's goals—maybe road safety tech, mobile innovation, cybersecurity, data analysis, and open-source contributions. 

I need to ensure all the courses provided are included in the completed courses section. Also, check that each project experience ties back to the required skills. The academic background should connect the courses to the project's needs, showing Devon's readiness. 

Make sure the profile is realistic. For example, a second-year student might not have too much work experience, so an internship or part-time role would be appropriate. The technical skills should match the project's requirements without overreaching. 

Finally, structure everything in the specified markdown format, keeping each section concise and relevant. Avoid any markdown in the thinking process, but the final answer must follow the format strictly. Double-check for any missing elements like the matched project title and generation time.
