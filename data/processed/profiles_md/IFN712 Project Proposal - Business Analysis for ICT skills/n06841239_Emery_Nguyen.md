Okay, let's start by looking at the project requirements. The project is about aligning ICT education with industry needs, specifically addressing the skills gap. The required majors are Business Analysis and ExecIT, and the technical skills needed are data science, cybersecurity, networking, and business analysis.

The user provided Emery Nguyen's basic info, including their Student ID and completed courses. I need to make sure the academic background, project experience, and skills align with these requirements. 

First, the academic background should reflect a blend of business analysis and ICT. Emery's courses include Computer Systems Fundamentals, Programming, Databases, Business Process Modelling, Business Intelligence Systems, Requirements Engineering, Cyber Security, and Systems Analysis and Design. That's a solid mix of technical and business courses. I should highlight how these courses have prepared Emery for the project, emphasizing both technical skills and business analysis.

Next, the project experience. Each project should be around 50 words. Let me think of three projects that combine the required skills. Maybe a Business Intelligence Dashboard, a Cybersecurity Risk Assessment, and a Systems Integration Project. These would showcase business analysis, data science, cybersecurity, and systems design.

Work experience: Since the project is academic, maybe Emery has internships or part-time roles. An internship in business analysis and a part-time role in IT support would show real-world application of the skills.

Interests should include things related to the project, like data science, cybersecurity, etc. Technical skills list should include the required ones: data science, cybersecurity, etc., plus others from the courses like SQL, Python, network security.

Make sure the matched project title is correct and the generation time is current. Check the markdown format strictly as per the user's instructions. Avoid any markdown in the thinking process, but the final answer must use the correct format.
