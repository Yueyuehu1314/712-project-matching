Okay, I need to create a student profile for Harper King based on the given project requirements. Let's start by looking at the project title and description. The project is about aligning ICT education with industry needs, addressing the skills gap. The required majors are Business Analysis and ExecIT. Technical skills needed are data science, cybersecurity, networking, and business analysis.

Harper's completed courses include several relevant ones like Business Intelligence Systems, Requirements Engineering, Cyber Security, etc. I need to make sure these courses are listed under the Completed Courses section. 

For the academic background, I should mention Harper's major in Business Analysis with a minor in ExecIT. Highlight courses that relate to business analysis, data science, and cybersecurity. Maybe mention group projects that involved collaboration with IT and business teams. 

Project experience should include projects that bridge education and industry. For example, a project where they analyzed business processes and proposed tech solutions. Another could be a cybersecurity risk assessment. A third project might involve designing a BI dashboard using Python and SQL. 

Work experience could be an internship at a consulting firm where they assisted in aligning business processes with IT systems. 

Technical skills need to include data science tools, cybersecurity protocols, business analysis techniques, and networking basics. 

Interests should reflect a passion for bridging education and industry, cybersecurity, data-driven decision making, etc. 

I need to ensure all the required technical skills are covered. Check if the courses match the project requirements. Make sure the project experiences demonstrate the skills needed for the project. Also, the academic background should show a solid foundation in both business and IT. 

Wait, the project title is "Aligning ICT Education with..." but the description is cut off. The main focus is on the skills gap between education and industry. So Harper's profile should show experience in analyzing business needs, understanding industry requirements, and using data to bridge gaps. 

In the academic background, maybe mention how the courses have prepared them to address such issues. For example, Requirements Engineering and Business Intelligence Systems would be directly relevant. 

Technical skills should include Python, SQL, Tableau, cybersecurity tools like Wireshark, network protocols, etc. 

I need to make sure all the completed courses listed by the user are included in the profile. The user provided specific course codes, so those should be accurately listed. 

Also, the matched project should be the given title, and generation time should be the current time. 

Let me structure each section step by step. Start with basic info, then academic background, completed courses, project experiences, work experience, interests, technical skills, and matched project. 

Check for word counts in each section. Academic background should be 150-200 words. Each project experience around 50 words. Work experience within 100 words. 

Make sure the language is professional but realistic for a student profile. Avoid jargon but include relevant terms from the project description. 

Double-check that all required elements from the project are addressed in the profile. For example, the skills gap, underemployment, emerging fields, digital economy productivity. Harper's experience and skills should align with addressing these issues. 

Alright, time to put it all together in the specified markdown format.
