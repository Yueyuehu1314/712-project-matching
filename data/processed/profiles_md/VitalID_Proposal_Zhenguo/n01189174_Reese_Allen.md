Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants a student profile for the VitalID project. First, I need to make sure I understand the project's requirements. The project is about smartphone-based user authentication using vital signs like heart rate and breathing. The required majors are Software Development and Computer, and the technical skills needed are machine learning, web development, data science, cybersecurity, mobile development, and networking.

The student's name is Reese Allen with the given ID and courses. I need to structure the profile in the specified markdown format. Starting with Basic Information, that's straightforward. For Academic Background, I should connect Reese's courses to the project. They've taken courses in programming, machine learning, web tech, cybersecurity, mobile dev, and networking. I need to highlight how each of these is relevant to VitalID.

Next, Completed Courses are already provided, so just list them. Project Experience: the user didn't provide specifics, but I need to create plausible projects that use the required skills. Maybe a mobile app with biometric features, a web-based data analysis tool, and a cybersecurity project. Each should be around 50 words.

Work Experience should be brief, maybe internships or part-time roles that align with the skills. Interests should reflect tech-related hobbies. Technical Skills need to list the required ones and maybe add some others like Python, React Native, etc. Finally, ensure the Matched Project is correctly titled and the time is current.

I need to check that all required skills are covered and the projects are relevant. Also, make sure the academic background explains how the courses prepare Reese for the project. Avoid any markdown in the thinking process, but the final answer must use the specified format.
