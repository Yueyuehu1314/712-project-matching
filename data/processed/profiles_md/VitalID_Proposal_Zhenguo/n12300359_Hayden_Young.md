Okay, let's start by understanding the user's request. They want a student profile for a project called VitalID, which is about smartphone-based user authentication using vital signs. The required majors are Software Development and Computer, and the technical skills needed are machine learning, web development, data science, cybersecurity, mobile development, networking.

First, the student's name is Hayden Young with a given student ID. The completed courses are listed, so I need to make sure those are included. The academic background should reflect the major and relevant courses. Since the project involves machine learning and cybersecurity, I should highlight courses like IFN564 Machine Learning and IFN623 Cyber Security.

Next, the project experience should align with the technical skills. Maybe create a few projects that use machine learning models, mobile apps, and security protocols. For example, a health monitoring app using ML, a secure mobile app with encryption, and a web-based dashboard for data analysis.

Work experience should be related to software development or cybersecurity. Maybe an internship where they worked on secure applications or data analysis.

Interests should include tech-related areas like AI, cybersecurity, mobile tech, etc. Technical skills need to cover all the required areas: Python, TensorFlow, React, Node.js, etc.

I need to make sure the academic background connects the courses to the project's needs. Emphasize how Hayden's coursework in machine learning, mobile development, and cybersecurity makes them a good fit. The project experiences should demonstrate hands-on experience with relevant technologies. Also, check that all required technical skills are listed under Technical Skills.

Make sure the matched project is VitalID and the generation time is current. Avoid any markdown in the thinking process, but the final answer should follow the specified markdown format.
