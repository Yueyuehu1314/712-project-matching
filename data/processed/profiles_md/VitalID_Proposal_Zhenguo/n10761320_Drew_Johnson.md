Okay, let's start by understanding the user's request. They need a student profile for a project called VitalID, which is about smartphone-based user authentication using vital signs. The required majors are Software Development and Computer (probably Computer Science). The technical skills needed include machine learning, web development, data science, cybersecurity, mobile development, and networking.

The student's basic info is provided: Drew Johnson, Student ID n10761320, and several completed courses. The task is to create a realistic profile that matches the project requirements. 

First, the major. The project mentions Software Development and Computer, so likely Computer Science or Software Engineering. Since the courses include things like Machine Learning and Cyber Security, a major in Computer Science with a focus on Software Engineering makes sense.

For the academic background, I need to highlight relevant coursework and skills. The completed courses include programming, machine learning, web tech, cybersecurity, mobile apps, etc. I should connect these to the project's needs. For example, IFN564 (Machine Learning) ties into the machine learning requirement. The academic background should mention how these courses have equipped the student with the necessary skills for the project.

Project experience needs to be three entries, each around 50 words. The projects should relate to the technical skills. Maybe a machine learning project for biometric authentication, a mobile app with security features, and a web-based data analysis tool. These would cover machine learning, mobile development, cybersecurity, and web tech.

Work experience: The user didn't provide any, but maybe an internship in software development or a related field. Something that involves applying the technical skills, like developing secure applications or working on data-driven projects.

Interests should align with the project's themes. Maybe cybersecurity, wearable tech, health tech, etc. Technical skills need to list all the required ones: machine learning, web dev, data science, cybersecurity, mobile dev, networking, etc.

Check that all required courses are included in the completed courses list. The user provided specific course codes and names, so those should be listed exactly as given.

Match the project title and current time. The generation time would be the current date when creating the profile.

Also, ensure the academic background is 150-200 words, so I need to elaborate on the courses and how they relate to the project. Mention specific skills gained, like Python, Java, cybersecurity principles, mobile app frameworks, etc.

In the project experience, each project should demonstrate a combination of the required skills. For example, the biometric authentication project uses machine learning and cybersecurity. The mobile app could involve mobile development and security. The web application would cover web tech and data science.

Work experience example: An internship where the student worked on secure mobile applications, integrating authentication methods and ensuring data protection. This ties in mobile dev and cybersecurity.

Interests should be relevant: cybersecurity, machine learning applications in health, mobile tech, data privacy, and networking. Technical skills list all the required ones from the project.

Make sure the profile is realistic. For example, a third-year student with the courses listed would have the necessary background. The major should align with the required fields. Avoid any inconsistencies.

Now, structure all this into the markdown format specified. Check each section for completeness and adherence to the guidelines. Ensure the word counts are respected for each section. Use the provided courses, name, and student ID. Don't add any extra information not requested. Confirm that the generated profile matches the project requirements and the given data.
