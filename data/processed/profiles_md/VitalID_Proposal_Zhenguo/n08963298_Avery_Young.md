Okay, let's start by understanding the user's request. They want a student profile for the VitalID project. The project is about smartphone-based user authentication using vital signs like heart rate and breathing patterns. The required majors are Software Development and Computer, with technical skills in machine learning, web development, data science, cybersecurity, mobile development, and networking.

First, the student's name is Avery Young, Student ID n08963298. The completed courses provided include programming, machine learning, web tech, cybersecurity, mobile app dev, security and networking, advanced software engineering, and databases. I need to map these courses to the project's requirements.

The academic background should highlight relevant coursework. For example, IFN564 Machine Learning is crucial for VitalID's machine learning aspects. IFN666 Web Technologies and IFN670 Mobile App Development connect to web and mobile development skills. IFN623 Cyber Security and IFN553 Security & Networking are important for cybersecurity and networking. IFN668 Advanced Software Engineering would show project management and software development skills.

Project experience needs to be three projects. Let's think of projects that align with the required skills. Maybe a biometric authentication system using machine learning, a secure mobile app with encryption, and a web-based dashboard for data analysis. Each project should be around 50 words.

Work experience: Maybe Avery interned at a cybersecurity firm or a startup working on mobile apps. That would tie in the practical application of their skills.

Interests should reflect areas relevant to the project, like cybersecurity, wearable tech, machine learning, etc. Technical skills need to include the required ones: Python, TensorFlow, React Native, Node.js, SQL, etc.

I need to ensure that the profile is realistic. The courses and projects should logically connect to the project's requirements. Also, the academic background should mention how each course contributes to the project. For example, databases (IFN554) would be relevant for storing user data securely.

Check if all the required technical skills are covered in the courses and projects. Make sure the work experience aligns with cybersecurity and mobile development. Avoid any markdown in the thinking process, just plain text. Finally, generate the profile in the specified markdown format, making sure it's in English and matches the project's needs.
