Okay, let's start by understanding the user's request. They need a student profile for the VitalID project. The project is about smartphone-based user authentication using vital signs like heart rate and breathing patterns. The required majors are Software Development and Computer, and the technical skills include machine learning, web development, data science, cybersecurity, mobile development, and networking.

First, the basic info is given: Blake Thompson, student ID n10055590. The completed courses are listed, so I need to make sure those are included. Now, the academic background should tie together his major and the courses he's taken. Since the project involves machine learning and mobile development, his academic background should highlight relevant coursework and skills.

Next, the project experience. The user provided three project placeholders. I need to create realistic projects that relate to the required skills. For example, a mobile app with biometric authentication (using machine learning) would fit. Another project could be a cybersecurity system for IoT devices, which relates to the cybersecurity course. A third could be a web-based data analytics tool, which covers web development and data science.

Work experience should be brief but relevant. Maybe an internship where he worked on mobile apps and security. Interests should reflect areas like cybersecurity and machine learning. Technical skills need to include all the required ones from the project: machine learning, web dev, data science, etc.

I also need to make sure the academic background is 150-200 words, each project description around 50 words. Check that all required courses are listed under Completed Courses. The matched project is VitalID, so the profile should emphasize skills directly applicable to that project.

Wait, the user provided specific courses. Let me list them again: IFN555, IFN564 (Machine Learning), IFN666 (Web Tech), IFN623 (Cyber Security), IFN670 (Mobile Dev), IFN553 (Security & Networking), IFN668 (Advanced Software Engineering), IFN554 (Databases). So the academic background should mention these courses and how they relate to the project's needs.

Also, the project description mentions using vital signs for authentication, which is different from traditional methods. So the student should have experience in machine learning for biometric systems, mobile app development, cybersecurity for data protection, and maybe networking for data transmission.

For the academic background, I can mention his focus on software development, machine learning, and cybersecurity. Highlighting his courses in Machine Learning, Mobile Application Development, Cyber Security, and Web Technologies will align with the project's requirements. His academic background should show he has the interdisciplinary skills needed.

In project experience, the first project could be a mobile app using machine learning for biometric authentication, which directly relates. The second project could involve cybersecurity for IoT devices, showing his ability to handle sensitive data. The third could be a web app that uses data analytics, tying in data science and web development.

Work experience: Maybe an internship where he developed secure mobile apps, integrating cybersecurity measures. That would cover mobile dev and cybersecurity, which are key for VitalID.

Interests: Cybersecurity, machine learning, mobile tech, health tech, data privacy. These all tie into the project's focus areas.

Technical skills must include all the required ones. Let me list them from the project: machine learning, web development, data science, cybersecurity, mobile development, networking. Then add others like Python, JavaScript, SQL, etc., based on the courses.

Now, I need to structure all this into the specified markdown format, ensuring each section is properly filled. Check word counts for academic background and project descriptions. Make sure the matched project title is VitalID and the generation time is current.
