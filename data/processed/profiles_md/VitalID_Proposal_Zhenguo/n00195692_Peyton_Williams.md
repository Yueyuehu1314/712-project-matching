Okay, let me start by understanding the user's request. They need a student profile for a project called VitalID, which is about smartphone-based user authentication using vital signs like heart rate and breathing. The required majors are Software Development and Computer, and the technical skills include machine learning, web development, data science, cybersecurity, mobile development, and networking. 

The user provided some basic info: name Peyton Williams, student ID n00195692, and a list of completed courses. I need to make sure the academic background, project experience, and skills align with the project's needs.

First, the academic background should mention Peyton's major, maybe Computer Science or a related field. The courses listed include programming, machine learning, web tech, cybersecurity, mobile dev, and networking. I should weave these into the academic background, highlighting relevant areas like machine learning for vital signs analysis and cybersecurity for data protection.

Next, the completed courses are already given, so I just need to list them properly. For project experience, I need to create 3 projects that relate to the required skills. Maybe a machine learning project for biometric data, a mobile app with security features, and a web-based dashboard for data visualization. Each project should be around 50 words.

Work experience: Maybe an internship in cybersecurity or software development. Interests should include tech-related activities. Technical skills need to cover the required areas: machine learning, web dev, data science, etc. Also, ensure the matched project title and generation time are included. I need to check the format strictly follows the markdown structure without any markdown in the thinking process. Let me make sure all sections are filled out and the content matches the project requirements.
