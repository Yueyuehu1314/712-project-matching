Okay, I need to generate a student profile for the project VitalID: Smartphone-Based. Let me start by looking at the project requirements and the given basic information about Skylar Harris.

First, the project is about user authentication using vital signs like heart rate and breathing. The required majors are Software Development and Computer Science. Technical skills needed include machine learning, web development, data science, cybersecurity, mobile development, and networking.

Skylar's completed courses include IFN555 (Programming), IFN564 (Machine Learning), IFN666 (Web Technologies), IFN623 (Cyber Security), IFN670 (Mobile App Development), IFN553 (Security and Networking), IFN668 (Advanced Software Engineering), and IFN554 (Databases). That's a solid mix of relevant courses.

For the academic background, I need to connect these courses to the project. Highlighting machine learning for analyzing vital signs, cybersecurity for data protection, mobile development for the app, and web tech for backend. Also, databases and networking for data handling.

Project experience should show relevant projects. Maybe a machine learning project on biometric data, a mobile app for health monitoring, and a cybersecurity project on secure data transmission. Each project should tie into the skills needed for VitalID.

Work experience: Internship in cybersecurity or software development would be good. Maybe at a company that deals with secure apps or health tech.

Interests should align with the project's areas: machine learning, cybersecurity, mobile tech, health monitoring, and network security.

Technical skills need to list the required ones. From the courses and projects, skills like Python, Java, React Native, TensorFlow, SQL, REST APIs, encryption, etc.

Make sure all sections are filled, follow the markdown format, and match the project needs. Check for consistency and realism. Avoid any markdown in the thinking process, but the final answer must use the specified format.
