Okay, let's start by looking at the project requirements. The project is about assessing IT skills in various professional domains for MIT graduates, focusing on business analysis. The required major is Business Analysis, and the technical skills needed are machine learning, web development, and business analysis.

The student provided is Taylor Torres, with specific courses completed. I need to make sure the academic background aligns with the project. Courses like Systems Analysis and Design, Web Technologies, Machine Learning are relevant here. 

Next, the academic background should mention how Taylor's studies have prepared them for this project. Emphasize skills in business analysis, systems design, databases, and machine learning. Maybe mention their hands-on experience with tools and methodologies used in industry surveys and data analysis.

For project experience, Taylor needs to have projects that mirror the project's requirements. Maybe a project where they conducted industry surveys, developed web-based tools for data collection, or applied machine learning in a business context. Each project should be around 50 words.

Work experience should be related to business analysis or IT. Perhaps an internship where they analyzed business processes or developed systems. Keep it concise within 100 words.

Interests should include things like data analysis, web development, business strategy, etc. Technical skills need to list the required ones plus others from the courses, like SQL, Python, etc.

Check the major is Business Analysis, year level, and make sure the completed courses match the ones provided. Also, ensure the matched project title and generation time are included. Need to make sure everything is in English and follows the markdown format strictly.
