Okay, let's start by looking at the project requirements. The project is called "Assessing the IT Skill" and it's focused on MIT graduates. They need someone with a Business Analysis major. The technical skills required are machine learning, web development, and business analysis. The project involves surveys, interviews, and working with sectors like spatial information, transportation, etc.

Hayden Scott is the student, and the given courses include Systems Analysis, Computer Systems Fundamentals, Databases, Web Technologies, Intro to Programming, Object-Oriented Programming, and Machine Learning. So, I need to map these courses to the project's needs.

First, the academic background should highlight business analysis, maybe mention their focus on IT and data-driven solutions. The completed courses list should be included as provided. For project experience, I need to create projects that relate to the required skills. Maybe a survey-based project for business analysis, a web app using web technologies, and a machine learning project. 

Work experience should show relevant internships, perhaps in business analysis or IT consulting. Interests should align with data analysis, web dev, etc. Technical skills need to include machine learning, web development, business analysis tools like SQL, Python, maybe some specific frameworks like React or TensorFlow.

Check if the major is Business Analysis. The user specified "Business analysis major only" for the project, so Hayden's major should be that. The academic background should reflect courses in business analysis and related IT skills. Also, ensure the project experience matches the sectors mentioned (transportation, spatial info, etc.) in the project description.

Make sure the matched project title is correct and the generation time is current. Avoid markdown and keep the thinking in English. Need to make sure everything is realistic and fits the project's needs. Also, check that the student's skills and experiences cover the required areas for the project.
