Okay, let's start by understanding the user's request. They want a student profile tailored for the "Assessing the IT Skill" project. The project is about analyzing IT skills in various professional domains, specifically requiring a Business Analysis major with skills in machine learning, web development, and business analysis. The student provided is Rowan Moore with certain completed courses.

First, I need to make sure the major is Business Analysis. The user specified that the required major is Business Analysis only, so I'll set that as the major. The year level should be appropriate for someone who has completed these courses; probably 3rd or 4th year.

Looking at the completed courses, they include Systems Analysis, Computer Systems, Databases, Web Technologies, and Machine Learning. These align well with the project's technical skills. I should list these courses as completed.

For academic background, I need to connect Rowan's studies to the project. Emphasize how the courses in systems analysis, databases, and machine learning provide a foundation for evaluating IT skills. Mention web technologies as well since that's a required skill.

Project experience should reflect work related to IT skills assessment. Maybe a project where they analyzed IT tools in civil engineering, another on web apps for transportation, and one using machine learning in spatial data. Each project needs to be around 50 words.

Work experience should be relevant. Perhaps an internship where they conducted business analysis for IT integration in engineering projects. Highlight survey design and data analysis skills.

Technical skills need to include machine learning, web development, business analysis, and others from the courses. Also, mention tools like Python, SQL, React, etc.

Interests should align with the project areas: data-driven decision making, tech in infrastructure, machine learning applications, etc.

Make sure the matched project is correctly titled and the generation time is current. Check all sections for relevance and that they meet the project's requirements.
