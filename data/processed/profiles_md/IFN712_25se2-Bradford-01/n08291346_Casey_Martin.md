Okay, let's start by looking at the project information. The project is about CRISPR and gene-editing, focusing on avoiding off-target effects. They need someone with AI background and skills in web development and data science. The student provided is Casey Martin, majoring in AI, which aligns well.

First, the academic background. Casey should have relevant courses in AI, data science, and programming. The completed courses listed include programming, OOP, databases, web tech, systems analysis. Need to connect these to the project. Maybe mention coursework in machine learning, bioinformatics, or algorithms related to sequence analysis.

Project experience should reflect handling large datasets and web tools. Maybe a project on bioinformatics data analysis, a web app for genomic data, and another on optimizing algorithms for DNA sequences. Each project should be around 50 words, so concise but specific.

Technical skills need to include Python, JavaScript, SQL, machine learning frameworks, data visualization, API development, etc. Also, mention tools like React or Node.js for web dev, and TensorFlow/PyTorch for ML.

Work experience could be an internship where they developed data pipelines or worked on AI models. Maybe a bioinformatics company to tie into the CRISPR project.

Interests should include bioinformatics, AI ethics, open-source contributions, etc., to show alignment with the project's goals.

Make sure the matched project title is correct and generation time is current. Avoid markdown in the thinking process, but the final answer should be in the specified format.
