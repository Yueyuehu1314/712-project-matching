Okay, let's start by understanding the user's request. They want a student profile for a project titled "The Power of Patterns: Using" which involves CRISPR gene-editing, specifically focusing on ensuring the system targets the correct gene to avoid off-target effects. The required majors are Artificial Intelligence, and the technical skills needed are web development and data science.

The student's basic info is provided: Sage Young, Student ID n08396782, with specific completed courses. I need to generate the rest of the profile accordingly.

First, the major should be Artificial Intelligence. The year level is probably third or fourth year, given the courses taken. The academic background should reflect a strong foundation in programming, data structures, algorithms, and AI. Since the project is CRISPR-related, maybe mention courses in bioinformatics or computational biology if applicable. But the given courses are more about programming and systems. So, focus on those.

Completed courses are listed, so I need to include those as provided. The project experience should align with the required skills. For example, projects involving web development, data analysis, or AI applications. Maybe a project on a gene sequence analysis tool for CRISPR? That would tie in the technical skills with the project's domain.

Work experience should be relevant. Maybe an internship in bioinformatics or a data science role where web development and data analysis were used. 

Interests should include AI, bioinformatics, data science, web development, and CRISPR technology. Technical skills need to cover web dev (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React), data science (Python, R, SQL, machine learning), and maybe some bioinformatics tools.

I need to ensure the academic background connects the courses to the project requirements. For example, IFN555 and IFN556 (programming courses) provide the foundation, while IFN666 (web tech) is directly relevant. Data science skills from courses not listed? Maybe they took electives in data analysis. Also, mention AI courses if possible, but the given courses don't include AI. Maybe the user expects me to infer that the major is AI, so the academic background should mention AI courses taken outside the listed ones. Wait, the completed courses provided are IFN555, IFN556, etc. Those are specific course codes. The academic background should explain how these courses relate to the project. For example, programming courses for developing algorithms, databases for handling large datasets, web tech for creating interfaces.

Project experience: Maybe a web app for sequence analysis, a data science project on gene expression, or an AI tool for pattern recognition. The project descriptions need to be concise, around 50 words each.

Work experience could be a bioinformatics intern where they developed web tools for data analysis, using Python and SQL. 

Make sure the matched project is the one provided, and generation time is current. Avoid markdown in the thinking process, but the final answer must be in the specified markdown format.
