Okay, let's start by understanding the user's query. They need a student profile for a project titled "The Power of Patterns: Using" which seems to involve CRISPR and gene-editing, focusing on targeting specific sequences without off-target effects. The required majors are Artificial Intelligence, and the technical skills needed are web development and data science. The student provided is River Harris with specific courses completed.

First, I need to make sure the student's academic background aligns with AI and the necessary technical skills. The courses listed include programming, web tech, systems analysis, databases, and data science. The academic background should reflect a focus on AI, data structures, algorithms, machine learning, etc. Maybe mention how these courses provide a foundation for handling large datasets and developing algorithms, which is relevant for CRISPR's sequence analysis.

Next, project experience. The user mentioned previous projects. I should create projects that tie into data science, web development, and AI. For example, a gene sequence analysis tool using Python and ML, a web app for data visualization, and maybe a bioinformatics project dealing with DNA sequences. Each project should be around 50 words, so concise but descriptive.

Work experience should be something related, maybe an internship at a biotech company where they worked on data analysis tools. That connects the AI and data science skills to the CRISPR project context.

Interests should include bioinformatics, machine learning, web dev, open-source, and bioethics. Technical skills need to list Python, JavaScript, SQL, machine learning frameworks, data visualization, etc., aligning with the required skills.

Need to ensure the matched project is correctly titled and the generation time is current. Also, check that all sections are filled as per the markdown format. Avoid any markdown in the thinking process but ensure the final answer is in the correct format. Make sure the academic background is 150-200 words, projects are each ~50 words, and work experience within 100 words. Also, use the provided student info accurately.
