Okay, let's start by understanding the user's query. They need a student profile for a project titled "The Power of Patterns: Using" which involves CRISPR gene-editing, focusing on avoiding off-target effects. The project requires Artificial Intelligence majors with skills in web development and data science. The student provided is Harper Wilson with specific courses.

First, I need to match the major. The required major is Artificial Intelligence, so Harper's major should be that. The year level isn't specified, but since they've completed several courses, maybe a third-year student. 

Looking at the completed courses: IFN555, IFN556, etc. These are programming and systems courses. I should list those as completed courses. The academic background should reflect these courses and how they relate to AI and data science. Mentioning programming skills, databases, web tech, which ties into the required skills.

Project experience needs to be relevant. The project involves pattern recognition and CRISPR, so maybe a project on bioinformatics or pattern matching algorithms. Harper could have worked on a DNA sequence analysis project using Python and machine learning. Another project could be a web app for data visualization, using their web development skills. A third project might involve optimizing algorithms for large datasets, which is relevant for handling DNA data.

Work experience should show practical application. Maybe an internship in a biotech company where they developed tools for genomic data. Or a research assistant role in a computational biology lab, applying data science techniques.

Technical skills must include web development (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React) and data science (Python, Pandas, NumPy, machine learning). Also, databases (SQL, NoSQL), and tools like Git. Maybe mention experience with CRISPR-related data analysis.

Interests should align with the project. Things like computational biology, bioinformatics, AI applications in healthcare, open-source web development, and data visualization.

Matching the project, the title is given, and the generation time is current. Need to ensure all elements are connected logically, showing Harper's capability to handle the CRISPR project with their AI, data science, and web skills.
