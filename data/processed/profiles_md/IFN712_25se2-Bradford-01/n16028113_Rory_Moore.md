Okay, let's start by understanding what the user needs. They want a student profile for a project titled "The Power of Patterns: Using" which involves CRISPR gene-editing. The project requires AI majors with skills in web development and data science. The student provided is Rory Moore with a list of completed courses.

First, I need to make sure the academic background aligns with AI. Rory's courses include databases, systems analysis, programming, and web tech. I should highlight how these courses provide a foundation for AI, especially in data handling and web development. Maybe mention machine learning or algorithms if they're relevant, even if not listed.

Next, the project experience. The user mentioned CRISPR's need for sequence matching. Rory's projects should reflect data processing, pattern recognition, or web apps. For example, a bioinformatics project using Python for sequence analysis, a web app for data visualization, and a machine learning project for pattern detection. Each project should tie into the required skills.

Work experience should show relevant internships. Maybe a data analyst role where they handled large datasets and built dashboards, which ties into data science and web dev.

Technical skills need to include web development (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React), data science (Python, Pandas, NumPy, machine learning), and databases (SQL, MongoDB). Also, bioinformatics tools like Biopython if applicable.

Interests should align with AI, bioinformatics, and web dev. Maybe mention CRISPR technology, data visualization, and open-source contributions.

I need to ensure all sections are filled properly, using the required format. Check that the matched project is correctly titled and the time is current. Avoid any markdown in the thinking process, but the final answer must be in the specified markdown format. Also, make sure the academic background is around 150-200 words and each project description is about 50 words. Let me structure all this coherently.
