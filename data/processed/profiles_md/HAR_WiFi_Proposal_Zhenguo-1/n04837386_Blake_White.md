Okay, let's start by understanding the user's request. They want a student profile for Blake White, who's working on an AI-Based Human Activity project using WiFi CSI. The project is in smart homes and healthcare, focusing on fall detection and activity monitoring. The required majors are Software Development and Computer, with technical skills in machine learning, web dev, data science, cybersecurity, mobile dev, networking.

First, I need to fill in the basic info. Name is Blake White, Student ID n04837386. The major should be Software Development or Computer Science. Since the courses listed include software engineering, security, networking, maybe a dual major? Let's go with Software Development and Computer Systems. Year level? The courses are advanced, so senior (4th year).

Academic background: He should have a strong foundation in software engineering, security, networking. Mention his focus on AI and machine learning in projects. Highlight courses like Advanced Software Engineering, Security and Networking, Cyber Security, etc. Also, his interest in privacy-preserving tech, which ties into the project's privacy aspect.

Completed courses are given. Just list them as is.

Project experience: Need three relevant projects. The first could be using WiFi CSI for activity recognition. Second, a mobile app for health monitoring. Third, secure web-based dashboard for data analysis. Each project should tie into the required skills.

Work experience: Maybe a software developer intern where he worked on AI and cybersecurity. Could mention developing secure web apps and mobile solutions.

Interests: Should include AI, machine learning, cybersecurity, IoT, privacy. These align with the project's needs.

Technical skills: Machine learning, web dev (React, Node.js), Python, TensorFlow, SQL, cybersecurity (encryption, network security), mobile dev (React Native, Swift), networking (TCP/IP, WiFi protocols). These cover all required skills.

Matched project: The given title and current time. Generation time would be 2023-10-05.

I need to ensure all project requirements are met. The profile should show he's capable in machine learning for activity recognition, web and mobile dev for the system, cybersecurity for privacy, and networking for WiFi CSI. The courses and projects should reflect these areas. Also, the academic background should mention his focus areas and how they relate to the project. Work experience should reinforce his practical skills. Interests and technical skills should cover all required areas. Make sure the profile is realistic, not too exaggerated, but shows competence.
