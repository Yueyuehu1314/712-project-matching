Okay, I need to create a student profile for Riley Young based on the given project and course information. Let me start by looking at the project requirements. The project is about AI-Based Human Activity Recognition using WiFi CSI. The required majors are Software Development and Computer (maybe Computer Science?), and the technical skills needed are machine learning, web development, data science, cybersecurity, mobile development, networking.

The student has completed several courses, including Advanced Software Engineering, Introduction to Security and Networking, Cyber Security, Systems Analysis and Design, Web Technologies, Mobile App Development, Computer Systems Fundamentals, and Databases. So I need to tie these courses to the project's technical skills.

For the academic background, I should mention Riley's major. The required majors are Software Development and Computer, so maybe Riley is majoring in Software Development with a minor in Computer Science or something similar. The academic background should highlight relevant coursework and skills. For example, Advanced Software Engineering and Web Technologies would relate to web development. Mobile Application Development is directly a match. Cyber Security and Introduction to Security and Networking cover cybersecurity. Systems Analysis and Design and Databases are part of data science. Computer Systems Fundamentals could tie into networking.

Project experience needs three projects. The project is about activity recognition using WiFi CSI. So possible projects could be related to sensor data analysis, mobile app development for health monitoring, or network security. For example, a project on analyzing sensor data for activity recognition would use machine learning and data science. A mobile app for health tracking would use mobile development. A network security project would use cybersecurity skills.

Work experience should be relevant. Maybe an internship in a related field, like a software developer intern working on web or mobile apps, or cybersecurity roles.

Technical skills should include all the required ones: machine learning, web dev, data science, cybersecurity, mobile dev, networking. Also, maybe add Python, JavaScript, etc., as specific languages.

Interests could include AI, cybersecurity, web and mobile development, data analysis, IoT.

Now, putting it all together in the specified markdown format. Make sure the academic background is 150-200 words. Check that each section matches the project requirements. Ensure the completed courses are listed as given. The matched project is AI-Based Human Activity, and the generation time is current, so I'll use the current date and time.
