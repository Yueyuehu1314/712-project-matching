Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants a student profile for a project called AI-Based Human Activity. The project uses WiFi CSI for activity recognition. The required majors are Software Development and Computer, and the technical skills needed are machine learning, web dev, data science, cybersecurity, mobile dev, networking.

First, the student's name is Jordan Wright with a specific student ID. They've completed several courses. I need to make sure the academic background aligns with the project. The courses listed include software engineering, security, networking, web tech, mobile dev, etc. So the academic background should highlight relevant areas like software engineering, cybersecurity, and systems design.

Next, the project experience needs to be three projects, each around 50 words. They should relate to the project's focus. Maybe a machine learning project for activity recognition, a web app for health monitoring, and a mobile app for security. Each project should tie into the required skills.

Work experience: Since the user didn't provide any, I can make up a relevant internship. Maybe a software developer intern where they worked on web apps and cybersecurity. That covers two of the required skills.

Interests should include tech-related hobbies. Maybe AI, cybersecurity, IoT, hiking, and open-source. Technical skills need to list all the required ones: machine learning, web dev, data science, cybersecurity, mobile dev, networking, plus Python, JavaScript, etc.

Make sure the matched project is correctly titled and the time is current. Also, check that all sections are in English and follow the markdown format exactly. Avoid any markdown in the thinking process, just plain text. Need to ensure the academic background is 150-200 words, so I'll elaborate on the courses and how they relate to the project. Also, the completed courses list should be in bullet points. Double-check the student ID and courses provided by the user. Align the technical skills with the project's requirements. Maybe add TensorFlow and React for machine learning and web dev. Ensure the profile is realistic, showing a well-rounded student with relevant experience.
