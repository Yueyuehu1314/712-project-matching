Okay, let's start by understanding the user's request. They want a student profile for Casey Garcia, matching the AI-Based Human Activity project. The project uses WiFi CSI for activity recognition, so the student needs skills in machine learning, web dev, data science, etc.

First, the basic info is provided, so I just need to fill in the major and year. The major should be Software Development or Computer Science, given the required majors. Let's go with Software Development. Year level—probably a postgraduate since some courses are advanced like IFN668.

Academic background should highlight relevant coursework. The user listed several courses, so I need to connect them to the project. For example, IFN668 (Advanced Software Engineering) relates to system design, IFN666 (Web Technologies) for web dev, IFN553 and IFN623 for networking and security. Also, mention data science and machine learning projects.

Completed courses are already given, so just list them.

Project experience needs three projects, each around 50 words. Let's think of projects related to machine learning, web apps, and networking. Maybe a fall detection system using sensors (similar to the project), a secure web app, and a mobile app with real-time data. Each should tie into the required skills.

Work experience should be brief, maybe a software developer intern with experience in web and mobile apps, cybersecurity. Highlighting collaboration and problem-solving.

Interests should include AI, cybersecurity, web dev, IoT, and privacy tech. These align with the project's focus areas.

Technical skills need to list the required ones: machine learning, web dev, data science, cybersecurity, mobile dev, networking. Also add Python, TensorFlow, WiFi CSI, React Native, SQL, etc.

Matched project is the given title and current time. Use the current date and time in the correct format.

Need to ensure everything connects well. Check that each part of the profile supports the project's technical requirements and that the skills and courses are relevant. Avoid making up courses not listed. Use realistic project names and descriptions that match the CSI application. Also, make sure the academic background explains how the courses prepare Casey for the project.
