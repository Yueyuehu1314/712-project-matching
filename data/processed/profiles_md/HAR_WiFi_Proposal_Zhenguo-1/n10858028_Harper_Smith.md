Okay, let's start by understanding the project requirements. The project is about AI-Based Human Activity Recognition using WiFi CSI. The required majors are Software Development and Computer, with technical skills in machine learning, web development, data science, cybersecurity, mobile development, networking.

The student's name is Harper Smith with the given ID and courses. I need to create a profile that matches these requirements.

First, basic info: Name, ID, major, year. The major should be Software Development. Year could be a senior or master's student since they have several courses listed. Let's go with 4th year undergrad or 1st year master's.

Academic background: Need to highlight relevant courses. The completed courses include Advanced Software Engineering, Security and Networking, Cyber Security, Systems Analysis, Web Technologies, Mobile App Development, Computer Systems, Databases. So the academic background should mention these courses and how they relate to the project. For example, IFN668 gives experience in software design, IFN553 and IFN623 in networking and security, which are relevant for WiFi CSI. Web and mobile dev courses are also needed for the project's interfaces.

Project experience: Need to create 3 projects that relate to the required skills. Maybe a WiFi-based activity recognition system using machine learning, a secure web app for health monitoring, and a mobile app for data collection. Each project should be around 50 words.

Work experience: Perhaps an internship in a related field, like a software developer at a tech company working on IoT or cybersecurity. Keep it concise.

Interests: Should include AI, cybersecurity, IoT, web and mobile dev, privacy in tech.

Technical skills: List the required skills: machine learning, web dev, data science, etc. Also include Python, TensorFlow, React, Node.js, SQL, etc., from the courses.

Matched project: The given project title and current time.

Make sure the profile is realistic. Harper should have a solid foundation in software and networking, with hands-on experience in relevant areas. The projects should showcase both technical skills and application to the project's context.
