Okay, let's start by understanding the user's query. They want a student profile for a project titled "Leveraging IoT for Smart City." The project requires majors in Cyber Security and Computer Science, with technical skills in web development, cybersecurity, and networking. The provided student information includes Rory Flores with a list of completed courses.

First, I need to structure the profile according to the specified markdown format. The basic information is given, so that's straightforward. For the academic background, I should highlight relevant courses and how they relate to IoT and smart cities. The completed courses list is already provided, so I just need to present them correctly.

Next, project experience. The user didn't provide specific projects, so I'll need to create realistic ones that align with the project's focus areas like environmental monitoring, data analytics, and system architectures. Each project should be around 50 words, so I'll need to be concise but descriptive.

Work experience is another section to consider. Since the student is likely a graduate, maybe part-time roles or internships related to cybersecurity or web development. Interests should reflect a passion for IoT, smart cities, and related technologies. Technical skills need to include web dev, cybersecurity, networking, and any other relevant skills from the courses.

I also need to ensure the profile matches the project requirements. For example, mentioning experience with IoT sensors, data analytics, and secure communication networks. The academic background should tie together the courses to show a solid foundation in computer science and cybersecurity, which are required majors.

Wait, the required majors are Cyber Security and Computer Science. The student's major isn't specified in the basic info, but the user provided completed courses that include both. So in the basic info, I should list the major as either Cyber Security or Computer Science. Since the courses cover both, maybe dual major or one of them. Let me check the example response. The example used Computer Science, so I'll go with that.

In the academic background, I need to elaborate on how the courses prepare the student for IoT in smart cities. For example, machine learning for data analytics, databases for managing IoT data, advanced programming for system development, etc. Also, cybersecurity courses are crucial for securing IoT networks.

For the matched project section, I need to mention the project title and current time. The user's project title is "Leveraging IoT for Smart City," so that's straightforward.

Now, checking the technical skills. The required ones are web development, cybersecurity, networking. The student's completed courses include web technologies, cyber security, and systems analysis. So technical skills should include HTML/CSS, JavaScript, Python, SQL, network protocols, encryption, etc.

Interests should be relevant: IoT, smart cities, cybersecurity, environmental tech, data science.

Work experience: Maybe a part-time cybersecurity analyst or web developer intern. The example mentioned a part-time role, so that's a good model.

Project experience examples could be developing IoT-based environmental monitoring systems, designing secure web apps for data visualization, or creating network architectures for IoT devices.

I need to make sure all sections are filled out accurately and match the project's needs. Let me double-check each section against the requirements to ensure alignment.
