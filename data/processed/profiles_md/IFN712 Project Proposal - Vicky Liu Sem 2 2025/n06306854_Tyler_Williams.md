Okay, let's start by understanding the user's request. They need a student profile for a project titled "Leveraging IoT for Smart City." The project involves IoT technologies like sensors, communication networks, and data analytics applied to areas such as flood control, earthquake detection, and emergency response. The required majors are Cyber Security and Computer Science, with technical skills in web development, cybersecurity, and networking.

First, the basic information is given: Tyler Williams, student ID n06306854. The major should align with the required ones, so Cyber Security or Computer Science. Since the completed courses include IFN623 Cyber Security and others like Machine Learning and Web Technologies, maybe a Cyber Security major makes sense here. Year level could be 3rd year as it's a common level for students with such courses.

For the academic background, I need to highlight his coursework in Cyber Security, Machine Learning, and Web Technologies. Emphasize how these courses relate to IoT, like data analytics, secure communication, and system design. Mention his focus on secure system integration and data-driven solutions.

Completed courses are listed, so I'll present those in bullet points. The user provided them, so just format them correctly.

Project experience should tie into IoT and smart city applications. Maybe create projects like "Smart Water Monitoring System" using sensors and data analytics, "Secure IoT Network Architecture" focusing on cybersecurity, and "Emergency Response IoT Platform" with real-time communication. Each project should be around 50 words.

Work experience should show relevant internships. Perhaps a Cybersecurity Intern at a company working on IoT solutions, handling secure communication protocols and threat analysis.

Interests should include areas related to IoT and cybersecurity, like smart cities, ethical hacking, sustainable tech, etc.

Technical skills need to cover web development (HTML, JavaScript, React), cybersecurity (encryption, threat analysis), networking (TCP/IP, Wi-Fi), and data analytics (Python, SQL). Also mention IoT platforms like Arduino and Raspberry Pi.

Ensure the matched project is correctly titled and the generation time is current. Check the format strictly follows the markdown structure provided. Avoid any markdown in the thinking process but the final answer must have it. Make sure everything is in English and realistic. Let me piece this together step by step, making sure each section aligns with the project requirements and the given information.
