Okay, let's start by understanding the user's request. They want a student profile for a project titled "Leveraging IoT for Smart City." The project is about IoT applications in smart cities, focusing on sensors, communication networks, data analytics, and real-world implementations. The required majors are Cyber Security and Computer Science, and the technical skills needed are web development, cybersecurity, and networking.

The student's basic info is provided: Devon White, student ID n11497005, with several completed courses. I need to generate the academic background, project experience, work experience, interests, and technical skills sections. The profile must align with the project's requirements.

First, the academic background. Devon is in Cyber Security, so I should highlight his coursework in databases, machine learning, web technologies, and cybersecurity. These courses are listed, so I can connect them to IoT and smart city concepts. For example, IFN564 Machine Learning could relate to data analytics in smart cities.

Completed courses are already given, so I just need to list them. Project experience needs three projects. The user's example includes projects related to IoT sensors, secure communication networks, and data analytics. Each project should tie into the project's focus areas like flood control, earthquake detection, etc. For instance, a project on real-time flood monitoring using IoT sensors would fit well.

Work experience should show relevant internships. Maybe a cybersecurity intern where he worked on securing IoT networks. That connects to the project's cybersecurity requirement.

Interests should reflect areas related to the project, like smart cities, IoT, sustainability, cybersecurity, and data analytics. Technical skills need to include web development (HTML, CSS, JavaScript), cybersecurity (firewalls, encryption), networking (TCP/IP, Wi-Fi protocols), and data analytics (Python, machine learning models).

I need to ensure all sections are concise and meet the word limits. The academic background should be 150-200 words, each project around 50 words. Work experience within 100 words. Avoid jargon but show technical proficiency. Make sure the profile is realistic and matches the project's needs. Also, check that all required courses and skills from the user's input are included. Finally, format everything in the specified markdown without markdown in the thinking process.
