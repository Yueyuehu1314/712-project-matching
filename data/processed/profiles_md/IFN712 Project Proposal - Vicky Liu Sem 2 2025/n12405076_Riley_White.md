Okay, so the user wants me to generate a student profile for a project titled "Leveraging IoT for Smart City." Let me start by understanding the project's requirements. The required majors are Cyber Security and Computer Science, and the technical skills needed are web development, cybersecurity, and networking.

The student provided is Riley White with a list of completed courses. I need to make sure the academic background and courses align with the project's needs. Let me check the courses: IFN564 Machine Learning, IFN554 Databases, IFN565 Advanced Programming, etc. These seem relevant for IoT and smart city projects, especially in data analytics and system design.

I need to structure the Academic Background to highlight relevant coursework. For example, Machine Learning is good for data analytics in IoT, Databases for handling IoT data, and Cyber Security for securing IoT systems. Also, the project mentions networking, so courses like Computer Systems Fundamentals and Systems Analysis should be emphasized.

Project Experience: The user mentioned three projects. Let me think of projects that tie into IoT and smart cities. Maybe a smart irrigation system using sensors (IoT), a secure web-based platform for environmental data (web dev and cybersecurity), and a network simulation for urban infrastructure (networking). These would showcase the necessary skills.

Work Experience should include something related to IoT or cybersecurity. Maybe an internship where they worked on IoT device security or network optimization. That would add practical experience.

Technical Skills need to include web development (HTML/CSS/JavaScript, frameworks like React), cybersecurity (encryption, firewalls), networking (TCP/IP, Wi-Fi), and others like Python, SQL, etc. Also, tools like TensorFlow from Machine Learning courses.

Interests should reflect passion for IoT, smart cities, sustainability, and tech innovation. Maybe include coding, cybersecurity challenges, environmental tech, and urban planning.

I need to make sure the profile is realistic. The student's background should show they have the necessary skills without being overqualified. The courses match the required areas, and the projects and work experience demonstrate application of those skills. Also, the matched project title and time need to be filled in correctly.

Let me check if all required sections are covered: Basic Info, Academic Background, Completed Courses, Project Experience, Work Experience, Interests, Technical Skills, and Matched Project. Yes. Now, structure each section with the right details, keeping descriptions concise and relevant. Avoid jargon but ensure technical terms are included where appropriate. Make sure the word counts are respected for each section. Finally, verify that everything aligns with the project's focus on IoT in smart cities, sustainability, public safety, and the required technical skills.
