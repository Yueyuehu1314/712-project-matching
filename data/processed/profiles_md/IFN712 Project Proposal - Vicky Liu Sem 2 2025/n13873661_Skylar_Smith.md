Okay, let's tackle this student profile for the "Leveraging IoT for Smart City" project. The user provided specific requirements, so I need to make sure everything aligns.

First, the student's name is Skylar Smith, and the ID is n13873661. The major is Cyber Security, and the year is 3rd year. The required majors are Cyber Security and Computer Science, so the major is covered. The technical skills needed are web development, cybersecurity, and networking. The completed courses include several relevant ones like IFN666 Web Technologies, IFN623 Cyber Security, and IFN552 Systems Analysis, which should be highlighted.

Academic background should show a strong foundation in both Cyber Security and areas related to IoT. I need to mention courses that relate to programming, systems design, and web tech. Maybe connect machine learning and databases as they are part of data analytics in IoT.

Project experience needs to be concise. The user provided three projects: Smart Waste Management System, Real-Time Environmental Monitoring, and Secure IoT Network Architecture. Each should be described in 50 words, emphasizing IoT, sensors, data analytics, and security.

Work experience could be a summer internship in Cyber Security, which ties into the project's security aspect. Interests should include IoT, smart cities, cybersecurity, data analytics, and sustainable tech. Technical skills should list the required ones plus others from the courses like Python, SQL, etc.

Make sure the matched project title is correct and the generation time is current. Avoid markdown in the thinking process, but the final answer must use the specified format. Check for any missing skills or courses that might be relevant to the project. Ensure the academic background flows well and connects the courses to the project's needs.
