Okay, I need to create a student profile for Harper Anderson based on the project requirements. Let me start by looking at the project details. The project is about monitoring ground deformation using InSAR, which is a remote sensing technique. The required majors are Data Science and Computer Science, and the technical skills needed are machine learning and data science.

First, the basic information is provided: name, student ID, and some courses. The major should be Data Science or Computer Science. Since the project requires both, maybe Data Science with a minor in Computer Science would be appropriate.

Next, the academic background. Harper has taken several courses in machine learning, data analytics, databases, systems analysis, computer systems fundamentals, programming, and algorithms. I need to connect these courses to the project. For example, machine learning (IFN564) is directly relevant. Advanced Data Analytics (IFN632) would help in analyzing large datasets from InSAR. Databases (IFN554) could be useful for managing the data. Systems Analysis and Design (IFN552) might relate to designing the system for processing radar images. Programming courses (IFN555, IFN556) and algorithms (IFN563) are essential for developing the necessary software tools.

Project experience should include projects that involve data analysis, machine learning models, and possibly image processing. For instance, a project on predictive modeling using machine learning, another on geospatial data analysis, and a third on developing a data pipeline for remote sensing data.

Work experience could involve internships in data science or remote sensing. Maybe something like an internship at a geospatial analytics company where they applied data science techniques to environmental monitoring.

Interests should align with the project. Geospatial technologies, environmental sustainability, machine learning, remote sensing, and data visualization.

Technical skills need to include machine learning, data science, Python, SQL, GIS software like QGIS, InSAR processing tools like SNAP, and cloud computing platforms. Also, programming languages like Python, R, Java, and C++.

I need to ensure that all the courses, projects, and skills are relevant to the project. The academic background should highlight how the courses prepare Harper for the project. The project experiences should demonstrate hands-on experience with data analysis, machine learning, and geospatial tools. The technical skills should cover both the data science and computer science aspects required by the project.

I should check if all the required elements are included: basic info, academic background, completed courses, project experience, work experience, interests, technical skills, and the matched project. Make sure the word counts are appropriate for each section. Also, the output should be in English and follow the specified markdown format without any markdown. Wait, the user said to output in English and use the markdown format as specified. So I need to structure it with the correct headers and bullet points.

Let me start drafting each section step by step, making sure to connect each part to the project requirements and show relevance. The academic background should explain how Harper's courses and projects have prepared them for the InSAR project. The technical skills should list all the necessary tools and languages. The work experience should provide practical experience related to the project. Interests should show a passion for the relevant fields. Finally, the matched project should list the project title and generation time.
