Okay, let's start by understanding the user's request. They need a student profile for Morgan Harris, tailored to a project about a systematic review of deep learning in medical X-ray imaging. The project requires Computer Science and Data Science majors with skills in machine learning, web development, data science, databases, and networking.

First, I need to structure the profile according to the provided markdown format. The basic info is given, so that's straightforward. For the academic background, I should highlight courses related to machine learning, programming, and data analysis. The completed courses listed include Machine Learning (IFN564), Advanced Programming (IFN565), and Web Technologies (IFN666), which align with the project's technical skills. I'll mention these courses in the academic background, emphasizing relevant skills like model evaluation and data processing.

Next, project experience needs to be relevant. The user mentioned three projects. I'll create names and descriptions that relate to deep learning, image processing, and web applications. For example, a project on CNNs for image classification, a web app for medical data visualization, and a database system for health data. Each project should briefly show skills applicable to the systematic review project.

Work experience should reflect hands-on experience. Maybe an internship in data science or a related field. I'll mention a role where they handled data analysis and developed ML models, which ties into the project's needs.

Interests should include areas like AI in healthcare, data visualization, and web development. Technical skills need to cover machine learning, Python, SQL, web frameworks, etc., aligning with the required skills. I'll list all the technical skills from the courses and add relevant ones like TensorFlow, Flask, and SQL.

I need to ensure that everything connects back to the project requirements. The academic background and courses should show preparation in machine learning and data science. Project experiences should demonstrate practical application in relevant domains. Technical skills must match what's needed for the systematic review, including data handling, model development, and web tech for presenting findings.

Also, check the word counts for each section. Academic background should be 150-200 words, each project around 50 words. Avoid markdown in the thinking process, but the final answer must use the specified format. Make sure the student's name and ID are correct, and the matched project title and time are included. Double-check that all required elements are present and logically connected to the project's goals.
