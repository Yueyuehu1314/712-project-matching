Okay, let's start by looking at the project requirements. The project is a systematic review of deep learning approaches for disease detection using medical X-ray imaging. The required majors are Computer Science and Data, and the technical skills include machine learning, web development, data science, database, and networking.

The student provided is Avery King, with the given courses. I need to create a realistic academic background that ties these courses to the project. Avery's courses include Machine Learning (IFN564), which is directly relevant. Also, courses like Systems Analysis and Design (IFN552) and Web Technologies (IFN666) cover web development and systems design, which are part of the required skills.

For the academic background, I should mention their focus on machine learning and data science, maybe some experience with medical data or imaging if possible. The project experience needs to be three projects related to the required skills. Maybe a machine learning project for disease detection, a web app for medical imaging, and a database project for handling medical data.

Work experience should be something related, like an internship in healthcare IT or data analysis. Technical skills need to include machine learning, web dev, data science, databases, networking. Also, maybe Python, TensorFlow, SQL, etc.

Interests should align with the project, like medical AI, data analysis, etc. Need to make sure all the required skills are covered and the projects match the project's focus on deep learning and medical imaging. Also, check that the student's courses are reflected in the academic background and projects.
