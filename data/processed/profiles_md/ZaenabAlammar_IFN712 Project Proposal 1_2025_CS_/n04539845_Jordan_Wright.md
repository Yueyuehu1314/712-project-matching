Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants a student profile for a project titled "A Systematic Review of Deep..." which is about deep learning for disease detection using X-ray imaging. The project requires majors in Computer Science and Data Science, with technical skills in machine learning, web development, data science, database, and networking.

First, I need to create a realistic student named Jordan Wright with the given student ID. The completed courses are provided, so I need to list those. Next, the academic background should highlight relevant coursework and experience. The student should have a strong foundation in machine learning, programming, and systems analysis.

Project experience needs to be three entries. Each should relate to the project's requirements. Maybe a machine learning project for medical image analysis, a web-based system for data management, and a project involving databases and networking. Each project description should be concise and relevant.

Work experience should show practical application of skills. Maybe an internship where they developed a machine learning model for image classification or worked on a web platform. Interests should include things like AI in healthcare, data science, etc. Technical skills need to cover the required areas: machine learning, web dev, data science, databases, networking. Also, include Python, TensorFlow, SQL, etc.

Need to make sure the profile matches the project's needs. The academic background should mention courses in machine learning, programming, systems analysis. The projects should reflect experience with ML models, web technologies, databases. Work experience could involve applying these skills in real-world settings. Also, ensure the technical skills list includes all the required areas and more. Check that the matched project is correctly named and the time is current. Avoid any markdown in the thinking process, but the final answer must be in the specified markdown format. Double-check all the user requirements to ensure nothing is missed.
