Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants a student profile for Blake Garcia with specific courses and the project on deep learning for disease detection using X-rays.

First, the basic info is given: name, ID, major, and year. The major should probably be Computer Science and Data Science since that's the required major for the project. Year level? Maybe third-year because the courses are advanced but not yet capstone level.

Academic background needs to highlight relevant courses and how they align with the project. The courses listed include machine learning, systems analysis, programming, algorithms, etc. So I should mention how these courses build a foundation for data analysis, ML, and software development. Maybe mention projects or labs where he applied these skills, like developing ML models or working with databases.

Completed courses are provided, so I just need to list them. For project experience, the user didn't specify any, so I have to create plausible ones based on the courses. Maybe a project on pneumonia detection using X-rays, another on web app for medical data, and a third on optimizing ML algorithms. Each project should tie into the required skills and the project's focus.

Work experience: Maybe an internship at a tech company where he worked on data analysis or web dev. This shows practical application.

Interests should include ML, medical tech, web dev, etc. Technical skills need to cover machine learning, web dev (HTML, JavaScript), data science tools (Python, TensorFlow), databases (SQL), networking basics, etc.

Need to ensure all the required technical skills from the project are covered. Also, the project title and generation time at the end. Let me check the project requirements again to make sure everything matches. Alright, time to structure the profile accordingly.
