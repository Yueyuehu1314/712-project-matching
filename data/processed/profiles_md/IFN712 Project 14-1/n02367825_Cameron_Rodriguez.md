Okay, I need to generate a student profile for Cameron Rodriguez based on the given project requirements. Let me start by understanding the project details. The project is about comparing binary and multiclass evaluation methods in IoT cybersecurity using datasets like CIC-IoT-2023. The required majors are Computer Science or Data Science, and the technical skills needed include machine learning, web development, data science, cybersecurity, networking, and business analysis.

First, the basic information is already provided: Cameron's name, student ID, and completed courses. The major should be Computer Science since the courses listed are typical for that field. The year level is probably third or fourth year given the advanced courses.

For the academic background, I should highlight Cameron's focus on machine learning, cybersecurity, and data systems. Mention the courses like Machine Learning (IFN564) and Algorithms and Complexity (IFN563) to show relevant skills. Also, note courses in computer systems and networking to align with the IoT environment context.

Completed courses are already listed, so I just need to format them correctly.

Project experience needs three projects related to the required skills. Possible projects could be a machine learning model for intrusion detection, a network security tool using Python, and a web-based dashboard for data visualization. Each project should tie into the project's requirements.

Work experience should reflect relevant internships. Maybe a cybersecurity intern at a tech company where they worked on threat detection systems using machine learning, which ties into the project's focus.

Interests should include cybersecurity, machine learning, IoT technologies, data analysis, and ethical hacking to show alignment with the project's themes.

Technical skills need to cover machine learning algorithms, Python, cybersecurity tools, web frameworks like Django, SQL/NoSQL databases, network protocols, data analysis libraries (Pandas, NumPy), and business analysis tools like Tableau. These skills match the project's requirements.

The matched project title is given, and the generation time should be the current time when creating the profile.

I need to ensure all sections are filled out, follow the markdown format, and the content is realistic and matches the project's needs. Check for consistency in the skills and experiences mentioned with the required areas. Avoid any markdown in the thinking process, but the final answer must use the specified markdown structure.
