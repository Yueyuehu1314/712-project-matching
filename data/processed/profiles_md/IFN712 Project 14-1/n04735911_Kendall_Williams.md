Okay, I need to generate a student profile for the project "Binary vs. Multiclass Evaluation." Let me start by looking at the user's input.

First, the project requires majors in Computer Science or Data Science. Kendall Williams is a Computer Science major, which fits. The technical skills needed are machine learning, web development, data science, cybersecurity, networking, and business analysis. I need to ensure these are covered in the skills section.

Looking at the completed courses provided: IFN564 Machine Learning, IFN563 Algorithms and Complexity, IFN551 Computer Systems Fundamentals, IFN555 Programming, IFN553 Security and Networking, IFN552 Systems Analysis, IFN554 Databases, IFN556 OOP. These courses should be listed under Completed Courses. I'll need to convert the course codes into full names if necessary, but the user provided the full names, so I can use those directly.

The Academic Background needs to be 150-200 words. I should mention Kendall's focus on machine learning, cybersecurity, and data analysis. Highlight their coursework in machine learning, algorithms, security, and programming. Also, mention projects or research related to the project, like intrusion detection or network security.

Project Experience: The user didn't provide specific projects, but the project descriptions should be around 50 words each. I'll create three relevant projects. Maybe an intrusion detection system using ML, a network traffic analysis tool, and a web app for security monitoring. Each project should tie into the required skills.

Work Experience: The user didn't specify any, so I'll create a relevant internship. Maybe a cybersecurity intern where they analyzed network data and developed ML models. This connects to the project's needs.

Interests should include cybersecurity, machine learning, data science, etc. Technical Skills need to list the required ones: machine learning algorithms, Python, TensorFlow, cybersecurity tools, networking protocols, web development (React, Django), SQL, business analysis tools like Tableau.

Matched Project is given, and the generation time is current. Need to format the date properly.

I need to make sure all sections are filled out as per the markdown structure. Check for consistency between courses, skills, and project experience. Ensure the academic background aligns with the project's requirements, like experience with classification models and IoT environments. Also, mention the CIC-IoT-2023 dataset in the project experience if possible. Avoid any markdown in the thinking process, but the final answer must use the specified markdown format.

# Student Profile

## Basic Information  
- **Name**: Kendall Williams  
- **Student ID**: n04735911  
- **Major**: Computer Science  
- **Year**: 3rd Year  

## Academic Background  
Kendall Williams is a dedicated Computer Science student with a strong foundation in machine learning, cybersecurity, and data analysis. Their academic focus has centered on developing secure, scalable systems for constrained environments, particularly IoT networks. Through coursework in machine learning (IFN564) and algorithms (IFN563), they have mastered classification techniques and optimization strategies. Their studies in security and networking (IFN553) and computer systems (IFN551) have equipped them with expertise in analyzing network vulnerabilities and designing robust intrusion detection systems. Kendall has also applied programming skills (IFN555, IFN556) to build data pipelines and model evaluation frameworks. Their capstone project on network traffic anomaly detection using Python and TensorFlow demonstrated their ability to implement machine learning models in real-world cybersecurity scenarios. With a passion for IoT security and a technical toolkit spanning data science and systems analysis, Kendall is well-prepared to tackle challenges in binary vs. multiclass classification for cyber threat detection.
