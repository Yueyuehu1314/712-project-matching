Okay, let's start by understanding the user's request. They need a student profile for a project titled "Feature Selection Impact on IoT." The project involves analyzing how different feature selection techniques affect IoT attack detection models using datasets like CIC-IoT-2023. The required majors are Computer Science and Data Science, with technical skills in machine learning, web development, data science, cybersecurity, and networking.

First, I need to create a profile for Rory Rodriguez with the given Student ID and courses. The academic background should highlight relevant coursework in data analytics, cybersecurity, and programming. The courses listed include databases, object-oriented programming, systems analysis, advanced data analytics, etc. I should connect these to the project requirements. For example, IFN632 Advanced Data Analytics and IFN619 Data Analytics and Visualisation are directly related to data science skills needed for the project.

Next, the academic background section needs to be around 150-200 words. I'll mention the major (Computer Science), focus areas like data science and cybersecurity, and how the courses have prepared the student for the project. Including hands-on experience with machine learning models and cybersecurity protocols would align well with the project's needs.

For project experience, the user mentioned three projects. I need to create realistic project titles and descriptions. Since the project involves feature selection in IoT, previous experience in similar areas would be good. For example, a project on anomaly detection in network traffic using machine learning, another on data visualization for cybersecurity, and a third on optimizing machine learning models with feature selection techniques. Each project should be about 50 words.

Work experience should be concise, within 100 words. The user hasn't provided specific info, so I'll create a relevant internship or part-time job. Maybe a Data Analyst Internship where they worked on data preprocessing, model evaluation, and collaborated on cybersecurity tools.

Interests should reflect the technical skills and project areas. Including things like machine learning, network security, data visualization, IoT ecosystems, and open-source projects would make sense.

Technical skills need to list the required skills: machine learning, web development, data science, cybersecurity, networking. Also, include related tools like Python, SQL, TensorFlow, Keras, Wireshark, etc.

The matched project is given, so I just need to fill in the title and current time. The generation time should be the current date and time when the profile is created.

I need to make sure all sections are filled out according to the markdown format provided. Check for consistency in the information, ensuring that the courses and projects align with the project's requirements. Avoid any markdown in the thinking process, but the final answer must strictly follow the specified format.

Also, ensure that the student's background is realistic. For example, having taken courses in cybersecurity and data analytics makes them a good fit for the IoT security project. Their project experience should demonstrate practical application of these skills, which strengthens the profile's relevance.

Finally, review the entire profile to ensure it meets the word counts and that all required sections are present. Make sure the language is professional and the information flows logically, highlighting the student's qualifications for the project.
