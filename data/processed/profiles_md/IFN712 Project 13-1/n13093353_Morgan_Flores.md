Okay, I need to create a student profile for Morgan Flores based on the project requirements. Let's start by looking at the project title and description. The project is about feature selection in IoT, specifically how different techniques affect attack detection models. The required majors are Computer Science and Data Science, and the technical skills include machine learning, web development, data science, cybersecurity, and networking.

Morgan's completed courses include several relevant ones like Machine Learning (IFN564), Advanced Data Analytics (IFN632), and Cyber Security (IFN623). I should highlight these courses in the academic background to show their relevance to the project. The academic background should mention courses in data analytics, machine learning, cybersecurity, and networking to align with the project's needs.

For project experience, the user provided three examples. I need to create three projects that tie into the required skills. Maybe one on machine learning for IoT data, another on cybersecurity with feature selection, and a third on web technologies. Each project should be around 50 words, so concise descriptions are key.

Work experience should reflect hands-on experience in relevant areas. Maybe a research assistant role focusing on data analytics and cybersecurity, and a web development internship. That covers both data science and web tech skills required.

Technical skills need to include machine learning algorithms, Python, R, TensorFlow, cybersecurity tools, networking protocols, web frameworks, and data visualization. Make sure to list all the required skills from the project.

Interests should align with the project areas: cybersecurity, machine learning, data science, IoT, and web development. Maybe add a personal interest in smart home tech to connect with IoT in the project description.

The matched project section should clearly state the title and generation time. Now, putting all together in the specified markdown format, ensuring each section is correctly filled with relevant information. Check for consistency between courses, skills, projects, and the project requirements to ensure a strong match.
