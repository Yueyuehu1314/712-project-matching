Okay, let's start by looking at the project requirements. The project is about Feature Selection Impact on IoT, specifically focusing on how different feature selection techniques affect IoT attack detection models. The required majors are Computer Science and Data Science, and the needed technical skills include machine learning, web development, data science, cybersecurity, and networking.

First, the student's basic information is given: Rowan Martin with student ID n04358655. They've completed several courses, which I need to list. The courses provided are IFN551, IFN632, IFN563, IFN564, IFN619, IFN666, IFN553, and IFN623. I should translate these course codes into their full titles and ensure they align with the project's technical skills. For example, IFN619 is Data Analytics and Visualisation, which fits data science. IFN666 is Web Technologies, covering web development. IFN623 is Cyber Security, directly relevant to cybersecurity.

Next, the academic background needs to summarize Rowan's studies, highlighting their focus areas. Since they have courses in data analytics, machine learning, and cybersecurity, the academic background should reflect a strong foundation in these areas. Maybe mention their thesis or projects related to IoT or feature selection.

Project experience should showcase relevant projects. The user mentioned the CIC-IoT-2023 dataset, so including a project that uses similar datasets would be good. For example, a project on intrusion detection using machine learning, another on optimizing data models with feature selection, and perhaps a web-based dashboard for visualizing security data.

Work experience should tie into the required skills. Maybe an internship in cybersecurity or data analysis. Highlighting tasks like developing ML models, analyzing network traffic, or creating visualizations would align well.

Technical skills need to list the required skills: machine learning, web development (like React or Node.js), data science tools (Python, Pandas), cybersecurity (firewalls, encryption), and networking (TCP/IP, Wireshark). Also, mention specific libraries or tools like Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, Docker, etc.

Interests should reflect both academic and personal. Maybe include cybersecurity research, data visualization, IoT technologies, open-source contributions, and tech hiking. These show a well-rounded interest in relevant areas.

The matched project is already given, so just need to ensure all elements tie back to it. Check that the courses and projects directly relate to the project's focus on feature selection in IoT datasets. Make sure the technical skills listed are all required for the project.

Also, ensure the profile is realistic. For example, a third-year student might not have too much work experience, but an internship is plausible. The courses should be from a relevant program, and the projects should build on those courses.

Finally, structure everything in the required markdown format without any markdown, as per the user's instruction. Make sure the academic background is concise (150-200 words), project experiences are brief (around 50 words each), work experience within 100 words, and the rest as specified.
