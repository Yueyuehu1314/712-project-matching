Okay, let's start by understanding the user's request. They want a student profile for a project titled "Feature Selection Impact on IoT." The project involves IoT attack detection using machine learning and feature selection techniques. The required majors are Computer Science and Data Science, with specific technical skills like machine learning, web development, data science, cybersecurity, and networking.

First, I need to create a realistic student named Harper Scott with the given student ID. The academic background should align with the required majors. Harper's completed courses include programming, security, networking, machine learning, and data analytics. I should structure the academic background to highlight relevant courses and skills.

Next, the project experience should reflect hands-on work related to the project. Possible projects could involve machine learning models for cybersecurity, feature selection in data analytics, and IoT network analysis. Each project description should be concise but relevant.

Work experience needs to be brief but pertinent. Maybe a cybersecurity internship or a data science project. Interests should include areas like cybersecurity, machine learning, etc., and technical skills must cover the required areas. I need to ensure all sections are filled out properly, following the markdown format strictly. Also, the matched project should be correctly named with the current time. Let me check if all required courses and skills are included and that the profile is cohesive and realistic.
