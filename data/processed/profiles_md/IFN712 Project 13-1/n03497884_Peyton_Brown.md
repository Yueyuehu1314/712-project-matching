Okay, I need to generate a student profile for Peyton Brown based on the given project requirements. Let me start by looking at the project details. The project is about feature selection in IoT security, using datasets like CIC-IoT-2023. The required majors are Computer Science and Data Science, and the technical skills needed are machine learning, web development, data science, cybersecurity, and networking.

First, the basic information is provided: name, student ID, and completed courses. I need to fill in the major and year. Since the courses include advanced data analytics and machine learning, it's likely a graduate student, maybe a second-year master's student. Major could be Data Science with a concentration in Computer Science.

Next, the academic background. I need to connect Peyton's courses to the project requirements. Mentioning courses in algorithms, machine learning, data analytics, and cybersecurity is important. Highlighting skills in feature selection, model optimization, and IoT security would align with the project's focus. Also, experience with tools like Python, TensorFlow, and Pandas should be included.

Completed courses are already listed, so I just need to present them in the correct format.

For project experience, I need to create three projects that relate to the required skills. Maybe one on machine learning for IoT data, another on cybersecurity with feature selection, and a third on web development for a dashboard. Each should be around 50 words.

Work experience should tie into the project. Perhaps an internship in cybersecurity or data analysis. Mentioning tasks like data preprocessing, model evaluation, and using tools like Scikit-learn and Keras would be good.

Interests should reflect the project's areas: machine learning, cybersecurity, data visualization, networking, and IoT. Technical skills need to cover the required areas: Python, machine learning libraries, web frameworks, cybersecurity tools, data visualization, network protocols, etc.

Finally, the matched project title and generation time. Need to make sure the profile is realistic and matches the project's needs. Check for consistency in the skills and courses with the project requirements. Make sure the academic background and projects show Peyton has the necessary experience to contribute to the project.
