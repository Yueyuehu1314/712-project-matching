Okay, let's start by understanding the user's request. They want a student profile for a project titled "Feature Selection Impact on IoT." The project involves analyzing how different feature selection techniques affect IoT attack detection models, using datasets like CIC-IoT-2023. The required majors are Computer Science and Data Science, with technical skills in machine learning, web development, data science, cybersecurity, and networking.

First, I need to create a realistic student named Jordan Davis with the given student ID. The academic background should align with the required majors. The completed courses provided include subjects like Computer Systems Fundamentals, Advanced Data Analytics, Machine Learning, and Cybersecurity. I need to ensure these courses are listed and that the academic background highlights relevant skills from these courses.

Next, the project experience should reflect hands-on work related to IoT, feature selection, and machine learning. Maybe include projects like "IoT Traffic Anomaly Detection" where they applied machine learning models, another on "Feature Selection in Network Data" using techniques like PCA, and a cybersecurity project involving intrusion detection. These projects tie into the project's requirements.

Work experience should show relevant internships. A Data Science Internship at a cybersecurity firm using machine learning for threat detection would fit well. Also, a Web Developer role where they built dashboards could showcase web development skills.

Technical skills need to cover machine learning (like Python, Scikit-learn), data science tools (Pandas, NumPy), cybersecurity knowledge (encryption, intrusion detection), and web development (React, Node.js). Networking and IoT protocols like MQTT should be included too.

Interests should align with the project's themes, such as IoT security, machine learning, and data visualization. Making sure all sections are concise and match the project's needs, ensuring Jordan is a suitable candidate with the right mix of academic background, technical skills, and project experience. Double-checking the format to meet the user's markdown structure and that all required elements are present without any markdown.
