Okay, let's start by looking at the project requirements. The project is about feature selection in IoT for cyberattack detection. The required majors are Computer Science and Data Science, with technical skills in machine learning, web development, data science, cybersecurity, and networking.

The student's name is Drew Hernandez, Student ID n04541718, and they've completed several courses. I need to create a realistic academic background that ties these courses to the project. Let me list the courses: IFN551, IFN632, IFN563, IFN564, IFN619, IFN666, IFN553, IFN623. 

For the academic background, I should mention their major, maybe Data Science with a Computer Science minor. Highlight courses in machine learning, data analytics, algorithms, and cybersecurity. Emphasize how these courses relate to the project's focus on feature selection and IoT security.

Completed courses are already provided. Now, project experience. They need three projects related to the skills. Let me think of projects that involve machine learning, data analytics, and cybersecurity. Maybe a feature selection project, a cybersecurity model, and a web-based dashboard for data visualization.

Work experience should be relevant, maybe a summer internship in cybersecurity or data analysis. Interests should align with the technical skills and project area, like cybersecurity, machine learning, IoT, etc.

Technical skills need to cover the required areas. List machine learning algorithms, Python libraries (Pandas, Scikit-learn), cybersecurity tools (Wireshark, Nmap), web dev (React, Node.js), networking protocols, data visualization tools (Tableau, Power BI), and feature selection techniques.

Make sure the matched project title is correct and the generation time is current. Check that all sections are filled out and formatted in markdown as specified. Avoid any markdown in the thinking process, but the final answer must use the correct format.
