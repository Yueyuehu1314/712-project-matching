Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants a student profile for the "Prosody & Perception" project. The project is about how prosody in speech affects user satisfaction in voice-based systems, especially for emotional and mental wellbeing. The required majors are Computer Science or Data Science, and the technical skills needed are machine learning and data science.

First, the student's name is Quinn King, ID n04552993. The completed courses are listed, so I need to make sure those courses align with the project requirements. The courses include programming, data analytics, algorithms, etc. Good, that fits with data science and machine learning.

For the academic background, I should highlight Quinn's focus on data science and computer science. Mention the courses that are relevant: data analytics, machine learning, algorithms. Maybe also note any projects or coursework related to NLP or audio processing since the project involves prosody.

Project experience should include something related to data analysis, machine learning models, and maybe a project involving audio or NLP. The user provided three project placeholders. Let me think of plausible project names. Maybe "Sentiment Analysis using NLP," "Predictive Modeling for User Engagement," and "Audio Feature Extraction for Emotion Recognition." Each should be a brief description linking to the project's focus on prosody and user perception.

Work experience: Maybe an internship where Quinn worked on data analysis or machine learning projects. Perhaps in a healthcare or tech company focusing on user experience or AI applications. Keep it concise, around 100 words.

Interests should include things like AI ethics, human-computer interaction, audio processing, etc. Technical skills need to cover machine learning algorithms, Python, data visualization tools, NLP libraries, audio processing software like MATLAB or Audacity, and maybe TensorFlow/PyTorch.

Make sure the academic background connects the courses to the project's needs. Emphasize skills in data science, ML, and any exposure to NLP or audio processing. The matched project is "Prosody & Perception: Toward a..." and the generation time is current.

Check if all required sections are filled. Basic info, academic background, completed courses, project experience, work experience, interests, technical skills, matched project. Ensure the profile is realistic and aligns well with the project's focus on prosody, user satisfaction, and ML/data science.
