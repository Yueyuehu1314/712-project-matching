Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants a student profile for a project on prosody and perception in voice-based conversational systems. The project is in Computer Science or Data Science, requiring machine learning and data science skills. The student provided is Riley Jackson with specific courses.

First, I need to make sure the academic background aligns. Riley has courses in programming, data analytics, algorithms, and systems. I should highlight how these courses prepare them for machine learning and data science. Maybe mention projects where they applied these skills, like analyzing datasets or building models.

Project experience is crucial. The user mentioned the project focuses on prosody, so I need to create relevant projects. For example, a project on speech emotion recognition using Python and ML libraries. Another could involve analyzing prosodic features in audio data. A third project could be about user perception of AI voices, using surveys and statistical analysis.

Work experience should tie into data science or ML. Maybe an internship at a startup where they developed a sentiment analysis model. This shows real-world application.

Interests should reflect both technical and creative sides. Coding, AI ethics, music production (since prosody relates to speech rhythm), hiking, and psychology. These interests show a well-rounded person with relevant passions.

Technical skills need to include machine learning, data science tools (Python, R, TensorFlow), data processing (Pandas, NumPy), statistical analysis, audio processing (Librosa), and visualization (Tableau, Matplotlib). Also, mention collaboration tools like Git and Jupyter.

The matched project is "Prosody & Perception: Toward a..." so the conclusion should link Riley's skills to the project's needs. Ensure the profile is realistic, with the right balance of academic, project, and work experience to fit the project's focus on prosody and user satisfaction in voice-based systems.
