Okay, let me start by understanding the user's request. They want a student profile for Sydney Martin, tailored to a project on prosody and perception in voice-based systems. The project requires Computer Science or Data Science majors with skills in machine learning and data science.

First, I need to create a realistic academic background. Sydney's major is likely Data Science or Computer Science. Since the courses listed include data analytics and programming, Data Science makes sense. The academic background should highlight relevant coursework and projects. I'll mention courses like Advanced Data Analytics and Data Analytics and Visualisation to align with the project's needs.

Next, the project experience section needs three projects. Each should relate to machine learning or data analysis. For example, a sentiment analysis project using NLP, a time-series forecasting project using machine learning, and a speech processing project focusing on prosody. These align with the project's focus on emotional engagement and prosodic variables.

Technical skills should include machine learning algorithms, data science tools, and programming languages like Python. Also, mention specific libraries such as TensorFlow, PyTorch, and scikit-learn. Since the project involves prosody, including signal processing and audio analysis tools like librosa is important.

Work experience should be brief, maybe an internship in data science where Sydney applied machine learning. Interests should reflect both technical and creative aspects, like AI ethics, music production, and psychology, which ties into the project's emotional and perceptual aspects.

I need to ensure all sections are concise and meet the word limits. The academic background should be 150-200 words, each project description around 50 words. Check that all required courses are listed and that the skills match the project requirements. Avoid any markdown and use the specified format. Finally, make sure the matched project title and generation time are correctly included.
