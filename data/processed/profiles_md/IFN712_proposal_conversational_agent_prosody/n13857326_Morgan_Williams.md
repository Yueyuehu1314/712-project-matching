Okay, I need to create a student profile for Morgan Williams based on the given project information. Let me start by understanding the project's requirements. The project is about prosody and perception in voice-based systems, focusing on emotional engagement through speech patterns. The required majors are Computer Science or Data Science, and the technical skills needed are machine learning and data science.

Morgan's completed courses include several relevant ones like Machine Learning (IFN564), Data Analytics and Visualization (IFN619), and Algorithms and Complexity (IFN563). These should be highlighted. The academic background should mention their focus on data science and machine learning, possibly with some coursework in NLP since the project mentions that. Also, since the project involves user perception, maybe some experience in human-computer interaction or related areas would be good to include.

For project experience, I need to come up with three projects that align with the project's focus. Maybe a project on sentiment analysis using NLP, another on developing a speech synthesis system with prosodic features, and a third on user experience studies related to voice interfaces. Each project should be around 50 words.

Work experience should be brief, maybe an internship in data science or a related field. Interests should include things like AI ethics, human-computer interaction, speech technology, etc. Technical skills should include machine learning, data analysis tools, Python, maybe some NLP libraries like NLTK or spaCy, and audio processing tools.

I need to make sure everything ties back to the project's needs. Also, check the format strictly: markdown with the specified sections. Avoid any markdown in the thinking process, but the final answer must be in the correct markdown format. Let me structure each section step by step, ensuring that the academic background, courses, projects, and skills all align with the project's focus on prosody, machine learning, and data science.
