Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants a student profile for a project on Prosody & Perception. The project is about how prosody in speech affects emotional engagement, and it requires Computer Science or Data Science majors with machine learning and data science skills.

First, the student's name is Riley Rodriguez, ID n13907629. They've taken courses like IFN555 Intro to Programming, IFN632 Advanced Data Analytics, etc. I need to map these courses to relevant skills. For example, IFN632 would cover data analysis techniques, IFN551 computer systems basics, IFN619 data visualization, which is important for presenting findings. Algorithms and Complexity (IFN563) would help in understanding machine learning algorithms.

Academic background should mention their major, maybe in Computer Science or Data Science. Since the project is interdisciplinary, combining NLP and prosody, the academic background should reflect both technical and analytical skills. Maybe mention coursework in machine learning, data analysis, and programming.

Project experience needs to be three projects. Let's think of ones related to speech processing, sentiment analysis, and data visualization. For example, a speech emotion recognition project using Python and ML libraries. Another could be a data analytics project on user feedback, which ties into perception. A third might involve building a voice assistant with prosodic features.

Work experience could be a data analyst intern where they handled data cleaning and visualization, which aligns with the required skills. 

Interests should include areas like AI ethics, speech tech, data visualization, etc. Technical skills need to list Python, ML frameworks, data tools like Pandas, visualization tools, and maybe some audio processing libraries.

Make sure the matched project is the given title and current time. Check the format strictly as per the user's markdown example. Also, ensure all the courses provided are listed under Completed Courses. Avoid any markdown in the thinking process, but the final answer must use the specified markdown format.
