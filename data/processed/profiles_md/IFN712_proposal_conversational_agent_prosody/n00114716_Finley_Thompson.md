Okay, let's start by understanding the user's request. They want a student profile for Finley Thompson, matching the project on Prosody & Perception. The project focuses on prosody in speech for emotional engagement, requiring Computer Science or Data Science majors with ML and data science skills.

First, the basic info is given, so I need to fill in the major and year. Since the courses are technical, Computer Science makes sense. The year should be a senior level, maybe 4th year, given the advanced courses.

Academic background needs to highlight relevant courses and skills. Finley has courses in programming, data analytics, algorithms, etc. Emphasize how these relate to the project. Mention ML and data science, which are required. Maybe note their focus on NLP and speech processing as part of their studies.

Completed courses are listed, so just need to present them in a markdown list. 

Project experience should include relevant projects. The user's project involves prosody, so past projects in speech analysis, ML models, and data visualization would be good. For example, a project on speech emotion recognition, a chatbot with NLP, and a data visualization tool for audio signals.

Work experience: Maybe an internship where they worked on ML models for user engagement, which ties back to the project's focus on user satisfaction.

Interests should reflect areas relevant to the project, like AI ethics, human-computer interaction, etc.

Technical skills need to include machine learning, Python, data analysis tools, NLP, audio processing, etc. Make sure the skills match the project requirements.

Matched project is the given title, and generation time is now.

I need to make sure everything is in the correct markdown format and that the content is realistic and relevant. Avoid any markdown in the thinking process, but the final answer should follow the structure strictly.
