Okay, let's start by understanding the project requirements. The project is about prosody and perception in voice-based systems, focusing on how users are influenced by speech rhythm, pitch, and intonation. It requires majors in Computer Science or Data Science, with technical skills in machine learning and data science.

The student's name is Harper White, with a given student ID. They've completed several courses, mostly in data analytics, algorithms, programming, and machine learning. I need to generate a realistic profile that matches these courses and the project's needs.

First, the academic background. Harper should have a major in Data Science. Since the project is interdisciplinary, maybe mention coursework in both computer science and data science. Highlight relevant courses like machine learning, algorithms, data analytics. Maybe note a thesis or project related to NLP or speech processing to tie into the project's focus.

Completed courses are listed, so I need to include those. The courses cover data analytics, algorithms, programming, systems analysis, databases, etc. All relevant for data science and machine learning.

Project experience should reflect hands-on work. Maybe a project on sentiment analysis using NLP, another on speech processing with prosodic features, and a third on building a recommendation system using machine learning. These would align with the project's goals of understanding prosody and user satisfaction.

Work experience could be an internship where Harper applied data science techniques, maybe in a tech company working on user engagement metrics. This shows real-world application of their skills.

Interests should include areas like AI ethics, speech technology, user experience design, which are relevant. Also, maybe some non-technical interests to show a well-rounded profile.

Technical skills need to list machine learning, data science tools, programming languages (Python, R, SQL), data visualization, NLP, speech processing libraries, and statistical analysis. These align with the required skills.

Make sure the matched project title and generation time are included. Check the format strictly follows the markdown structure without any deviations. Avoid markdown in the thinking process, but the final answer must use the specified markdown format.

Also, ensure the academic background section is 150-200 words, project experiences each around 50 words. Work experience within 100 words. Keep the language professional but realistic for a student profile. Avoid any technical jargon that's too advanced or irrelevant. Make sure everything ties back to the project's focus on prosody and user perception.
