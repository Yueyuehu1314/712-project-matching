Okay, let's start by understanding the user's request. They need a student profile for a project titled "Prosody & Perception: Toward a" which focuses on how prosody in speech affects emotional engagement. The project requires Computer Science or Data Science majors with skills in machine learning and data science.

First, the basic information is given: Finley Flores, Student ID n06955897. The major should be either Computer Science or Data Science. Since the project involves both, maybe Data Science is more fitting. The year level isn't specified, so I'll assume a senior year, like 3rd or 4th year.

Next, the academic background. The student should have a strong foundation in data analytics, programming, and algorithms. The completed courses provided include programming, data analytics, systems design, etc. So the academic background should highlight courses in data science, machine learning, and computer systems. Mention relevant skills like statistical analysis, programming languages (Python, R), and data visualization.

Project experience needs to be relevant. The projects should relate to data analytics, machine learning, or speech processing. Maybe something like analyzing speech patterns, developing ML models for emotion detection, or a data visualization project. Each project should be brief, around 50 words.

Work experience should align with the project. Perhaps an internship in data analysis or a research assistant role in NLP or ML. Keep it concise, within 100 words.

Interests should reflect areas related to the project, such as AI ethics, speech technology, data visualization, human-computer interaction, and mental health tech. Technical skills need to include machine learning, data science tools (Python, R, TensorFlow, SQL), data processing, statistical analysis, and maybe some speech processing libraries. Also, programming languages like Python, Java, C++.

Ensure the matched project title is correct and the generation time is current. Check that all sections are filled according to the markdown format provided. Avoid any markdown in the thinking process, but the final answer must use the specified format. Make sure the profile is realistic and matches the project requirements closely.
