Okay, let's start by understanding what the user needs. They want a student profile for a project titled "Prosody & Perception: Toward a..." which focuses on how prosody affects emotional engagement in voice-based systems. The project requires majors in Computer Science or Data Science, with technical skills in machine learning and data science. The student's name is Kendall Johnson with the given student ID and completed courses.

First, I need to create a realistic academic background. Kendall has taken courses in data analytics, algorithms, advanced programming, systems analysis, programming, machine learning, computer systems, and databases. The academic background should highlight their expertise in these areas. Maybe mention their focus on machine learning and data analytics, and how their courses have prepared them for this project.

Next, the project experience. The user mentioned three projects. I need to think of projects related to machine learning and data science. For example, a sentiment analysis project using NLP, a speech recognition system, and maybe a recommendation system that uses collaborative filtering. Each project should be around 50 words and tie into the required skills.

Work experience should be within 100 words. Maybe an internship where they worked on data analysis or machine learning projects. For instance, interning at a tech company working on chatbots that use NLP and prosody analysis.

Interests should include things like AI ethics, voice interfaces, and data visualization. Technical skills need to cover Python, machine learning libraries (scikit-learn, TensorFlow), SQL, NLP techniques, speech processing tools (like PyDub), data visualization (Matplotlib, Tableau), and cloud platforms (AWS, GCP). Also, mention version control with Git.

Make sure the matched project title and generation time are included. The generation time should be the current date and time. Need to check all the requirements again to ensure nothing is missed. The academic background should be 150-200 words, so elaborate on their coursework and how it relates to the project. Avoid any markdown and use proper English throughout. Ensure all the technical skills and courses align with the project's needs in machine learning and data science. Double-check the student's name and ID to match the provided details. Finally, structure everything according to the specified markdown format without any deviations.

# Student Profile  

## Basic Information  
- **Name**: Kendall Johnson  
- **Student ID**: n05458643  
- **Major**: Data Science  
- **Year**: 4th Year  

## Academic Background  
Kendall Johnson is a 4th-year Data Science student with a strong foundation in machine learning, algorithms, and systems analysis. Their coursework emphasizes data-driven problem-solving, particularly in NLP and predictive modeling. IFN619 (Data Analytics and Visualisation) honed their ability to interpret complex datasets, while IFN564 (Machine Learning) equipped them with skills in supervised and unsupervised learning techniques. Projects in IFN565 (Advanced Programming) and IFN552 (Systems Analysis) developed their proficiency in designing scalable systems and integrating voice-based interfaces. Kendall is particularly interested in how prosodic features (e.g., pitch, rhythm) influence human-computer interaction, aligning with their research in user-centric AI systems. Their academic journey has prepared them to tackle interdisciplinary challenges at the intersection of data science and affective computing.  

## Completed Courses  
- IFN619 Data Analytics and Visualisation

## Project Experience  
### Sentiment Analysis via Voice Modulation  
Developed a machine learning model to classify emotional states using prosodic features (pitch, tempo) extracted from speech recordings, achieving 82% accuracy with a Random Forest classifier.  

### Speech-to-Text System Optimization  
Designed a real-time speech recognition pipeline using Python and PyDub, integrating noise reduction algorithms to improve transcription accuracy in noisy environments.  

### Personalized Mental Health Chatbot  
Built a chatbot prototype that adapts tone and pacing based on user input, leveraging NLP techniques to enhance emotional engagement in mental wellness applications.  

## Work Experience  
Kendall interned at a tech startup specializing in AI-driven customer support tools. They contributed to a voice analytics project by preprocessing audio data, extracting prosodic features, and training models to detect user frustration in call center interactions. Their work directly informed the development of a user satisfaction scoring system, improving client retention by 15%.
