Machine learning is the science of getting computers to act
without being explicitly programmed. This unit provides you with
a broad introduction to machine learning and its statistical
foundations. Topics include: definition of machine learning tasks;
classification principles and methods; dimensionality
reduction/subspace methods; and deep learning methods such
as convolutional neural networks and transformers. The unit
makes use of python, jupyterlab, git and state of the art machine
learning libraries. In addition to addressing specific machine
learning methods, we will consider the ethical implications of
machine learning in applications where individuals or groups
could be marginalised, and the computational cost of machine
learning methods and ways to reduce the compute burden.
Application examples are taken from areas such as computer
vision, finance, market prediction and information retrieval.

Cloud Computing is among the most important developments in
the IT industry in recent years, and one which has received
enormous attention. Cloud is a natural progression from earlier
trends in service and infrastructure outsourcing and
virtualisation, but is distinguished by its elasticity and scale:
service and infrastructure provisioning may change rapidly in
response to variations in demand, allowing clients to cater for
unexpected spikes in load without tying up capital in expensive
and potentially underutilised assets. Cloud services and
technologies are becoming increasingly diverse and
sophisticated, moving rapidly from the original 'bare metal'
offerings and providing a rich set of options and APIs. This unit
provides a technically oriented introduction to Cloud Computing,
giving you experience in developing modern cloud applications
and deploying them to the public clouds of the major vendors.

before. It introduces the basic building blocks of algorithms:
sequence, selection and iteration and how algorithmic thinking is
used to decompose problems into simpler steps. The C#
language is used for expressing those steps in a programming
language. It introduces an imperative style of programming in
which a sequence of statements change the program’s state.
The program’s state consists of a set of variables that contain
data of various types. We introduce basic data types
including numbers, text strings and lists. Students are also
introduced to processes for debugging and testing programs
to ensure their correctness and the forms of professional
communication associated with software development.

In this unit you will learn how the principles of Object-Oriented
programming can help combat complexity when developing
larger programs. The key concepts are abstraction and
encapsulation. Abstraction is the processing of giving a name to
something plus generalization – the process of ignoring
differences and instead identifying common properties of a
collection of objects. Encapsulation is the process of “putting
things in a box” – selectively exposing some aspects of what’s in
the box, but deliberately hiding much of what is in the box. In
object-oriented programming languages classes and methods
provide the principle mechanism for abstraction and
encapsulation.

Builds upon the concepts that you have learned in IFN556,
introducing methods of Object Oriented Design which will allow
you to solve more complex, real world problems. In this unit you
will learn how to identify potential objects and classes by
examining the real-world context that the programming is
modelling. By basing our software design on entities that exist in
the real world, we maximise the chances that our software
architecture will age and evolve gracefully - i.e. we won’t need to
restructure our application completely as the requirements
change. This is because our choice of objects is stable - the
entities that an organisation needs to deal with (for example
Customers, Invoices, Vehicles and Projects) will not change
completely overnight. You will also learn about and apply several
standard software design principles and patterns. Finally, you
will learn how such designs are professionally communicated
and used as part of object-oriented software design processes.

Object orientation is a program design principle applicable to
software at various scales. In this unit you will extend your
knowledge of small-scale object-oriented programming to large-
scale systems in which the classes and objects mirror their real-
world counterparts in the business-level processes the software
supports (e.g., customers, orders, products, projects, etc). To do
so you will learn about and apply several standard software
design principles and patterns applicable to large-scale IT
systems, and you will learn how such designs are communicated
professionally and used as part of object-oriented software
development processes. You will then implement those designs
in an industry-standard object-oriented programming language,
making use of its various library modules. Depending on the
nature of the practical projects you complete this could require
implementing user interfaces, executing concurrent threads,
interacting with databases, and so on.

In contemporary societies, Humans often interact with
information by means of technologically driven systems. As our
information environment becomes ever more complex, these
interactions are becoming more and more diverse. While much
is understood about the systems side of this picture, much less
is understood about how humans interact with technology-
mediated information.   Students will investigate cognitive,
technological and theoretical perspectives of how humans
interact with and process information when interacting with
contemporary information technologies (e.g. conversational
agents, wearable technologies, generative AI). This
understanding will be translated into conceptual frameworks and
associated design principles for critiquing and curating effective

Human-centred design is an approach to developing interactive
technology that puts the people we are designing for at the heart
of the process. in this unit, you will learn human-centred design
by working collaboratively with end users and organisations to
understand their needs and contexts, define the problem,
develop technology ideas and prototypes, and evaluate them.
This process is widely recognised as a key success factor for
interactive technologies that shape how we live, work, socialise,

The data that modern data scientists have access to is larger
and more complex than in previous generations. Dealing with
these data requires specialised algorithms and the use of a
higher performance or cloud computing environment. This unit
outlines the challenges and opportunities associated with big
data and introduces machine learning algorithms that scale to
large datasets. This unit will expand on the material presented in
earlier data science units and students will use their
programming knowledge to implement machine learning
algorithms to address real world problems.

Biology and medicine are becoming data-intensive disciplines.
From new sequencing technologies to electronic health records
and wearable devices, it has never been easier or cheaper to
generate biomedical data. This provides a great opportunity to
study complex biological systems, to offer better patient
care, etc., but working with this data is not trivial. This advanced
unit will teach you how to handle and analyse biomedical data,
as well as gain an appreciation of its strengths, limitations and
complexities so that you can understand and critically interpret
measurements and analyses. The unit aims to provide you
with knowledge of modern biomedical technologies and the
associated data science methodologies, building on what you
have learned in IFN509.

This unit introduces a number of process analysis techniques
used during the design, execution, and post-execution stages of
the Business Process Management (BPM) life cycle. BPM
provides organisations with the ability to save money and time
by systematically  documenting, managing, automating, and
optimising their business processes. To unlock the true benefits
of a process-aware organisation, it is essential that process
modelling efforts do not purely remain paper-based but act as
the prelude to automated support. The last decade has seen an
increased uptake of process automation and workflow
technology, which has increased the potential for real, evidence-
based analysis associated with the execution of various
business processes. By applying techniques such as process
verification, process simulation, and process mining, we
can gain  insights into both the current and future business
operations of an organisation, which in turn can lead to
continuous process improvement.

Biomedical data analytics is a growing field servicing diagnostics
and therapeutics, patient medicine, preventative and precision
medicine, health economics, telehealth, and medical research.
Historically, graduates were trained in single discipline areas,
meaning you studied biomedical science or data analytics.
However, now that much of the data generated in biomedical
science represents big data, there is an increasing demand for
employees who can analyse data in a contextually relevant way.
As a biomedical data analyst, you will combine your knowledge,
skills, and experience as a laboratory-trained biomedical
scientist with advanced data analytics training, which means you
can design experiments and deliver results to take projects from
the wet lab through the data analysis pipeline, asking and
answering the right questions of the data to deliver results in a
biologically meaningful way.
