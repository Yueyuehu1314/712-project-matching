Okay, let's start by understanding the user's request. They need a student profile for a project that requires Python, programming, and machine learning skills. The student is in the IN27 (Data Analytics) program at QUT. The provided courses include several relevant ones like Machine Learning and Advanced Machine Learning.

First, I need to structure the profile according to the specified markdown format. The basic info is given: Rory King, student ID, major, year. The academic background should highlight the IN27 program and relevant courses. I'll mention the courses listed, emphasizing machine learning and statistical methods.

Next, completed courses are listed, so I need to include those exactly as provided. For project experience, I should create three projects that align with the required skills. Maybe something with Python scripts, machine learning models, and data visualization. Each project should be a concise 50-word description.

Work experience: Since the user didn't provide specific info, I'll create a plausible role, like a Data Analyst Intern using Python and machine learning. Interests should include data science, Python, etc. Technical skills need to cover Python, machine learning libraries, SQL, etc.

I need to ensure all the technical skills listed match what's required for the project. Also, the matched project title and generation time should be filled. Let me check the word counts for each section to stay within limits. Academic background should be 150-200 words, so I'll detail the courses and their relevance. Projects each around 50 words. Work experience within 100 words. Make sure everything is in English and follows the markdown structure strictly. Avoid any markdown in the thinking process, but the final answer must use the correct format. Double-check the courses and technical skills to align with the project requirements. That should cover all the bases.
