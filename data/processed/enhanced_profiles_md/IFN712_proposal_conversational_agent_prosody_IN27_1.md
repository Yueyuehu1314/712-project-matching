Okay, let's start by looking at the user's query. They want a student profile for Finley Miller, who's in the IN27 Data Analytics program at QUT. The project requires machine learning skills, so the profile needs to highlight that.

First, I need to structure the profile according to the provided markdown format. The basic info is given, so I'll fill that in. The academic background should mention the IN27 course and the relevant units, especially those related to machine learning and data analytics. The completed courses listed include IFN707 and IFN709, which are Machine Learning and Advanced Machine Learning, so I should emphasize those.

For project experience, the user provided three projects. Each should be a brief description showing application of machine learning. I'll need to create realistic project titles and descriptions that tie into the skills required. Work experience should reflect practical application, maybe an internship or part-time role in data analytics.

Interests should include data science, machine learning, etc., aligning with the technical skills. Technical skills need to list Python, R, SQL, TensorFlow, etc., as these are relevant for a data analytics major. 

I need to ensure all the information matches the project requirements and the IN27 course outline. The matched project section should link to the given project title and current time. Also, check that the word counts for each section are within the specified limits. Make sure the academic background is 150-200 words and project descriptions are around 50 words each. Avoid any markdown in the thinking process, but the final answer must follow the markdown structure strictly.
