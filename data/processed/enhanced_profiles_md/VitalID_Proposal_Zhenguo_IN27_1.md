Okay, let's start by understanding the user's request. They want a student profile for Finley Miller based on the provided project and course information. The project requires Python, programming, and machine learning skills, and the student is in the IN27 (Data Analytics) course.

First, I need to structure the profile as specified. The basic info is given: name, ID, major, year, and course background. The academic background should highlight IN27, so I'll mention the Master's program and relevant courses. I'll note the research and technical skills developed through the courses listed.

Next, the completed courses are provided. I'll list them exactly as given. For project experience, the user hasn't provided specific project names, so I'll create realistic ones that align with the required skills. For example, a machine learning project using Python, a data visualization project, and a research project. Each description should be concise and relevant.

Work experience should be brief, maybe an internship related to data analytics. Interests should reflect a data analyst's hobbies, like coding and data science. Technical skills need to include Python, machine learning, and other relevant tools mentioned in the courses.

I need to ensure all the technical skills listed match what's required for the project. Also, the matched project title and generation time should be included. I have to make sure everything is in English and follows the markdown format strictly. Let me double-check the course codes and project details to ensure accuracy and relevance to the IN27 program and project requirements.
