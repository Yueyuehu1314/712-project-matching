Okay, let's start by looking at the user's query. They want a student profile for a project that requires machine learning skills. The student, Parker Taylor, has an IN20 background in Computer Science. The user provided some completed courses, including IFN709 - Advanced Machine Learning, which is key here.

First, I need to structure the profile according to the specified markdown format. The basic info is given, so I'll fill that in. For the academic background, since the course outline is unreadable, I'll have to infer based on typical IN20 courses. IN20 is a Computer Science program at QUT, so common courses might include programming, algorithms, data structures, and maybe some AI or machine learning topics.

The completed courses listed include Advanced Machine Learning, so I should highlight that in the academic background. Also, the project experience needs to tie into machine learning. The user mentioned the project requires machine learning, so the student's projects should reflect that. I'll create a few relevant projects, like a recommendation system, image classification, and a time-series forecasting model.

Work experience should be something related, maybe an internship at a tech company working on ML models. Interests should align with tech and ML, like AI ethics, data science, etc. Technical skills need to include Python, TensorFlow, PyTorch, and others relevant to ML.

I need to make sure everything is in English and follows the markdown structure. Also, the matched project title and time should be filled in. Let me check if all the required sections are covered and that the content matches the project's needs. Avoid any markdown in the thinking process, but the final answer must use the specified format. Let me double-check the user's instructions to ensure compliance.
