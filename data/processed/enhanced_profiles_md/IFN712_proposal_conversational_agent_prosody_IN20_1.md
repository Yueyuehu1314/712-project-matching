Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants a student profile for Tyler Allen based on the given project and course info. First, I need to parse all the provided data.

The project title and description aren't specified, but the required major is Computer Science and the technical skill is machine learning. The student's courses include several advanced ones like IFN709 - Advanced Machine Learning, which is key here. The IN20 background is mentioned, but the course outline is missing due to OCR issues. So I need to rely on the completed courses to build the academic background.

Tyler's completed courses are IFN712, IFN701, IFN702, IFN703, IFN704, IFN709. These courses cover research methods, programming, software engineering, databases, and advanced machine learning. The academic background should highlight these, especially linking them to the project's ML requirements. I need to mention how these courses have equipped him with skills in research, programming, and ML.

For the project experience, the user didn't specify projects, so I'll create realistic ones based on his courses. For example, a Machine Learning Research Project under IFN712, a Software Engineering project using Java and databases, and a Data Analysis project with Python and databases.

Work experience should align with his skills. Maybe a Research Assistant role where he used Python and ML libraries. Interests should reflect his academic focus, like AI, data analysis, etc. Technical skills need to list relevant ones from his courses: Python, ML libraries, SQL, Java, etc.

I need to ensure all sections are filled, using the required format. The matched project is unspecified, so I'll leave the title blank but note the generation time. Also, check that the profile is in English and fits a realistic IN20 student. Avoid any markdown and use the specified structure. Let me piece this together step by step, making sure each part connects to the project's needs and his background.
