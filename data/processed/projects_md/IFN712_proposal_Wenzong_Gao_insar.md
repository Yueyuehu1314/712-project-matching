| Brief description of the research | Monitoring ground deformation is  |
| problem, gaps, aims, methodology  | critical for understanding the    |
| and expected outputs (\~200       | stability of urban infrastructure |
| words)                            | and for mitigating risks from     |
|                                   | natural and human-induced changes |
|                                   | such as groundwater extraction,   |
|                                   | construction, mining, or          |
|                                   | earthquakes. Interferometric      |
|                                   | Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR)  |
|                                   | is a satellite-based remote       |
|                                   | sensing technique that enables    |
|                                   | precise measurement of surface    |
|                                   | movement over large areas and     |
|                                   | time periods by comparing radar   |
|                                   | images of the same location taken |
|                                   | at different times. This          |
|                                   | technology can detect even        |
|                                   | millimetre-level changes in       |
|                                   | ground elevation, regardless of   |
|                                   | weather or lighting conditions.   |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | This project aims to investigate  |
|                                   | ground deformation across the     |
|                                   | Brisbane area using InSAR         |
|                                   | technology. The approach involves |
|                                   | collecting freely available SAR   |
|                                   | data (such as Sentinel-1          |
|                                   | satellite images) covering the    |
|                                   | Brisbane region, and processing   |
|                                   | these images using the SNAP       |
|                                   | (Sentinel Application Platform)   |
|                                   | software to generate              |
|                                   | interferograms and deformation    |
|                                   | maps. A key focus of this project |
|                                   | is to study the impact of using   |
|                                   | different types of orbit files    |
|                                   | (such as precise or restituted    |
|                                   | orbits) and various Digital       |
|                                   | Elevation Model (DEM) files       |
|                                   | during the InSAR processing       |
|                                   | workflow. By comparing results    |
|                                   | from different processing         |
|                                   | options, the project will         |
|                                   | highlight how orbit and DEM       |
|                                   | choices affect the accuracy and   |
|                                   | quality of the final deformation  |
|                                   | maps.                             |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | The processed results will be     |
|                                   | analysed to identify, map, and    |
|                                   | quantify any patterns of ground   |
|                                   | movement in different parts of    |
|                                   | Brisbane. The project will result |
|                                   | in a reproducible workflow for    |
|                                   | SAR data processing, clear        |
|                                   | visualizations and measurements   |
|                                   | of detected deformation, and      |
|                                   | practical recommendations for     |
|                                   | ongoing monitoring or further     |
|                                   | geospatial studies in the region. |
