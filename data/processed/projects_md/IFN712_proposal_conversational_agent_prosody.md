| Brief description of the research | Conversational technologies are   |
| problem, gaps, aims, methodology  | increasingly used for emotional   |
| and expected outputs (\~200       | and mental wellbeing support,     |
| words)                            | making user satisfaction vital to |
|                                   | their success. While most         |
|                                   | research focuses on Natural       |
|                                   | Language Processing (NLP) and     |
|                                   | generative models that detect and |
|                                   | respond to emotional content in   |
|                                   | text, far less attention has been |
|                                   | given to prosody, the rhythm,     |
|                                   | pitch, and intonation of speech,  |
|                                   | and its role in shaping emotional |
|                                   | engagement.                       |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | This study explores how users     |
|                                   | perceive and are influenced by    |
|                                   | prosodic variables in voice-based |
|                                   | conversational agents. Building   |
|                                   | on prior reviews that emphasize a |
|                                   | reliance on textual emotion       |
|                                   | detection, it investigates        |
|                                   | whether and how vocal cues        |
|                                   | enhance perceived empathy, trust, |
|                                   | and psychological safety in       |
|                                   | human--AI interactions.           |
|                                   | Understanding prosody's impact    |
|                                   | will support the development of   |
|                                   | more emotionally attuned,         |
|                                   | accessible voice technologies for |
|                                   | mental health support.            |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | To do this, the study examines    |
|                                   | how users interpret prosodic      |
|                                   | features in relation to emotional |
|                                   | understanding and conversational  |
|                                   | ease. Despite existing work       |
|                                   | linking text to emotion, no       |
|                                   | dataset currently captures how    |
|                                   | users subjectively experience     |
|                                   | ease of listening or emotional    |
|                                   | resonance in response to prosodic |
|                                   | variation.                        |
