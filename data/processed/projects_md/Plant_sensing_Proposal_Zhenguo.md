| expected outputs (100\~200 words) | monitoring, early detection of    |
|                                   | plant stress caused by factors    |
|                                   | such as nutrient deficiency,      |
|                                   | disease, or inadequate water      |
|                                   | supply is critical. Traditional   |
|                                   | approaches often depend on manual |
|                                   | observation or the use of         |
|                                   | high-end multispectral imaging    |
|                                   | systems, which tend to be         |
|                                   | expensive and difficult to scale. |
|                                   | Spectral reflectance analysis     |
|                                   | provides a non-invasive and       |
|                                   | cost-effective alternative,       |
|                                   | particularly when used with       |
|                                   | controlled lighting and compact   |
|                                   | spectral sensors.                 |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | When plant leaves are illuminated |
|                                   | with red, green, and blue light,  |
|                                   | their reflectance patterns vary   |
|                                   | depending on their physiological  |
|                                   | condition. These differences can  |
|                                   | be measured using spectral        |
|                                   | sensors and analyzed to assess    |
|                                   | plant health. By integrating this |
|                                   | sensing process into an IoT-based |
|                                   | system, it becomes possible to    |
|                                   | continuously monitor plant status |
|                                   | and transmit data in real time.   |

|                                   | a complete solution that combines |

|                                   | visualisation, enabling both      |
|                                   | automatic classification and      |
|                                   | manual control through a remote   |
