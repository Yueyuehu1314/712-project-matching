| problem, aims, method and         | Vulnerable Road Users             |
| expected outputs (100\~200 words) | (VRUs)---including pedestrians,   |
|                                   | cyclists, and scooter             |
|                                   | riders---face a                   |
|                                   | disproportionately high risk of   |
|                                   | collisions at signalized          |
|                                   | intersections due to limited      |
|                                   | situational awareness and delayed |
|                                   | warnings. While intelligent       |
|                                   | transport systems have improved   |
|                                   | vehicular safety, few solutions   |
|                                   | offer direct, real-time           |

|                                   | safety challenges by empowering   |
|                                   | VRUs with actionable,             |
