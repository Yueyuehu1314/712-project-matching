| Brief description of the research | This project aims to conduct a    |
| problem, aims, method and         | comprehensive literature review   |
| expected outputs (100\~200 words) | on deep learning approaches for   |
|                                   | disease detection using medical   |
|                                   | X-ray imaging data. X-ray remains |
|                                   | a widely used diagnostic modality |
|                                   | for detecting various conditions  |
|                                   | such as pneumonia, fractures,     |
|                                   | dental issues, and lung           |
|                                   | abnormalities. With the rapid     |
|                                   | advancement of deep learning,     |
|                                   | numerous models have been         |
|                                   | developed to improve diagnostic   |
|                                   | accuracy, speed, and consistency  |
|                                   | in interpreting X-ray images.     |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | The primary aim is to identify    |
|                                   | and evaluate recent studies that  |
|                                   | apply deep learning techniques to |
|                                   | disease detection in X-ray        |
|                                   | imaging. The methodology involves |
|                                   | a systematic search and critical  |
|                                   | review of peer-reviewed articles, |
|                                   | focusing on model architectures   |
|                                   | (e.g., CNNs, Transformers),       |
|                                   | datasets, performance metrics,    |
|                                   | and clinical relevance.           |
|                                   |                                   |

|                                   |     current literature, such as   |
|                                   |     lack of generalizability,     |
|                                   |     data limitations, or          |
|                                   |     insufficient                  |
